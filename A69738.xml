            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <head>An Advertiſement concerning this Edition.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I</hi> Hope I ſhall incur no blame from thoſe who deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly value this Excellent BOOK of Mr. <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingworth,</hi> for having made it of a leſſer bulk and an eaſier purchaſe than before, after I have told them my way of proceeding herein: I have not Epitomized it in the uſual way, by contracting any where his ſenſe, and giving it more briefly in words of my own; which would have been indeed an injury to him, who knew ſo well how to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs his own ſenſe fully and perſpicuouſly beyond moſt men, without any redundancy of ſtyle; but by paring off and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving out ſome parts of it, which I thought might be well ſpared, and make the Reading of his Book more pleaſant, as well as more generally uſeful, when his defence of the Proteſtant Doctrins and the cauſe of the Reformation lay more cloſely together, not being interrupted with ſo many pages ſpent to juſtifie Dr. <hi>Potter</hi> in the perſonal conteſts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt him and his adverſary; or in detecting the ſophiſtry, frauds and falſities of the Jeſuit, where the matter was not of common concern. But where I thought it was, I have been ſcrupulouſly careful to omit nothing: ſo far from it, that I am apt upon a review to think, that the pleaſure of reading his admirable Confutation, has bribed me to inſert more than was needful, in purſuance of my firſt deſign.</p>
                  <p>The reaſon why the Jeſuits Book which Mr. <hi>Chilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth</hi> anſwers is not here reprinted, was partly becauſe it is too tedious and wordy, abounding in impertinent cavils, and affecting to fetch a great compaſs to amuſe and loſe the
<pb facs="tcp:57896:3"/>Reader before he comes to the point in Queſtion, which he ſcarce ever attempts cloſely to prove; and chiefly becauſe Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi> has commonly all along ſet down in a different Character, as much of his words, as was needful to let the Reader ſee, what it is he makes a Reply to, and where I found any omiſſion of this kind, I have tranſcribed out of the Jeſuits Book ſuch paſſages and citations, as might give further light to it: beſides, that every one who has a mind, or any doubt remaining about this matter, may eaſily conſult the Folio Edition &amp; ſatisfie himſelf.</p>
                  <p>I have added a large <hi>Table of Contents</hi> at the end which was wanting before, whereby the Reader may find any Argument or head of Diſcourſe therein contained, with little or no trouble; which Table will ſerve any Edition of the Book, becauſe the numbers after the Chapter refer to the diviſions of the Chapters at the ſide, not to the Pages at the top.</p>
                  <p>As for the Additional pieces that follow the Book, and were never before printed, he that reads them will find by the clearneſs of expreſſion, the cloſe way of arguing and ſtrength of reaſoning, ſufficient to convince him that they are not ſpurious, but the genuine productions of this great Man; but yet for his further ſatisfaction he may know, that the Manuſcript out of which moſt of them were faithfully tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, is an Original of Mr. <hi>Chillingworths</hi> own hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writing, and now in the cuſtody of the Reverend Dr. <hi>Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſon,</hi> to whom he is beholden for their preſent Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>

                  </opener>
                  <p>I Preſent, with all humility to Your moſt ſacred Hands, a Defence of that Cauſe which is and ought to be infinitely dearer to you, than all the world: Not doubting but upon this Dedication I ſhall be cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for a double boldneſs; both for undertaking ſo great a Work, ſo far beyond my weak abilities, and again, for preſenting it to ſuch a Patron, whoſe judgment I ought to fear more than any Adverſary. But for the firſt, it is a ſatisfaction to my ſelf, and may be to others, that I was not drawn to it out of any vain opinion of my ſelf, (whoſe perſonal defects are the only thing which I preſume to know,) but undertook it in obedience to Him, who ſaid, <hi>Tu Converſus confirma fratres,</hi> not to <hi>S. Peter</hi> only but to all men: being encouraged alſo to it by the goodneſs of the Cauſe, which is able to make a weak man ſtrong. To the belief here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I was not led partially or by chance, as many are, by the prejudice and prepoſſeſſion of their Country, Education and ſuch like inducements, which if they lead to truth in one place, perhaps lead to error in a hundred; but having with the greateſt equality and indifferency, made enquiry and ſearch into the grounds on both ſides, I was willing to impart to
<pb facs="tcp:57896:4"/>others that ſatisfaction which was given to my ſelf. For my inſcribing to it your Majeſties ſacred Name, I ſhould labour much in my excuſe of it from high preſumption, had it not ſome appearance of Title to your Majeſties Patronage and protection as being a Defence of that Book, which by ſpecial Order from Your Majeſty was written ſome years ſince chiefly for the general good, but peradventure not without ſome aim at the recovery of One of your meaneſt Subjects from a dangerous deviation, and ſo due unto your Majeſty, as the fruit of your own High humility and moſt Royal Charity. Beſides, it is in a manner nothing elſe, but a purſuance of, and a ſuperſtruction upon that bleſſed Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin, wherewith I have adorn'd and arm'd the Frontiſpiece of my Book, which was ſo earneſtly recommended by your Royal Father of happy memory, to all the lovers of Truth and Peace, that is to all that were like himſelf, as the only hopeful means of healing the breaches of Chriſtendom, whereof the Enemy of ſouls makes ſuch peſtilent advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. The luſtre of this bleſſed Doctrin I have here endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to uncloud and unveil, and to free it from thoſe miſts and fumes which have been rais'd to obſcure it, by that Order, which envenoms even poiſon it ſelf, and makes the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion much more malignant and turbulent than otherwiſe it would be; whoſe very Rule and Doctrin, obliges them to make all men, as much as lies in them, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects unto Kings, and ſervants unto Chriſt, no farther than it ſhall pleaſe the Pope. So that whether Your Majeſty be conſidered, either as a pious Son towards your Royal Father K. <hi>James,</hi> or as a tender hearted and compaſſionate Son towards your diſtreſſed Mother, the Catholick Church, or as a King of your Subjects, or as a Servant unto Chriſt, this work, (to which I can give no other commendation, but that it was intended to do you ſervice in all theſe capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,) may pretend not unreaſonably to your Gracious ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance.
<pb facs="tcp:57896:4"/>Laſtly being a Defence of that whole Church and Religion you profeſs, it could not be ſo proper to any Patron as to the great Defender of it; which ſtile Your Majeſty hath ever ſo exactly made good, both in ſecuring it from all dangers, and in vindicating it (by the well order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and rectifying this Church) from all the foul aſperſions both of Domeſtick and Forein enemies, of which they can have no ground, but their own malice and want of Charity. But it's an argument of a deſpairing and loſt cauſe to ſupport it ſelf with theſe impetuous outcries and clamors, the faint refuges of thoſe that want better arguments; like that Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ick in <hi>Lucian</hi> that cried <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>O damn'd villain,</hi> when he could ſay nothing elſe. Neither is it credible the wiſer ſort of them ſhould believe this their own horrid aſſertion, That a God of goodneſs ſhould damn to eternal torments, thoſe that love him and love truth, for errors which they fall into through humane frailty! But this they muſt ſay, otherwiſe their only great argument from their damning us, and our not being ſo peremptory in damning them, becauſe we hope unaffected Ignorance may excuſe them, would be loſt: and therefore they are engaged to act on this Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical part, only to fright the ſimple and ignorant, as we do little children by telling them that bites, which we would not have them meddle with. And truly that herein they do but act a part, and know themſelves to do ſo, and deal with us here as they do with the King of <hi>Spain</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> whom they accurſe and Eccommunicate for faſhion ſake on <hi>Maundy-Thurſday,</hi> for detaining part of S. <hi>Peters</hi> Patrimony, and abſolve him without ſatisfaction on <hi>Good-Friday,</hi> me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks their faltring and inconſtancy herein, makes it very apparent. For though for the moſt part, they ſpeak no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but thunder and lightning to us, and damn us all without mercy or exception, yet ſometimes to ſerve other purpoſes, they can be content to ſpeak to us in a milder
<pb facs="tcp:57896:5"/>ſtrain, and tell us, as my adverſary does, more than once, <hi>That they allow Proteſtants as much Charity as Proteſtants al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them.</hi> Neither is this the only contradiction which I have diſcovered in this uncharitable Work; but have ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that by forgetting himſelf, and retracting moſt of the principal grounds he builds upon, he hath ſaved me the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of a confutation; which yet I have not in any place found any ſuch labour or difficulty, but that it was under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takeable by a man of very mean, that is, of my abilities. And the reaſon is, becauſe it is Truth I plead for; which is ſo ſtrong an argument for it ſelf, that it needs only light to diſcover it: whereas it concerns Falſhood and Error to uſe diſguiſes and ſhadowings and all the fetches of Art and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſtry, and therefore it ſtands in need of abler men, to give that a colour at leaſt, which hath no real body to ſubſiſt by. If my endeavors in this kind may contribute any thing to this diſcovery, and the making plain that Truth (which my Charity perſwades me the moſt part of them diſaffect only, becauſe it has not been well repreſented to them,) I have the fruit of my labour, and my wiſh; who deſire to live to no other end, than to do ſervice to Gods Church and Your moſt Sacred Majeſty, in the quality of</p>

                     <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>UPON the firſt news of the publication of your Book, I uſed all diligence with ſpeed to procure it; and came with ſuch a mind to the reading of it, as <hi>S. Auſtin</hi> before he was a ſetled Catholick, brought to his conference with <hi>Fauſtus</hi> the Manichee. For as he thought, that if any thing more then ordinary might be ſaid in defence of the Manichean Doctrine, <hi>Fauſtus</hi> was the man from whom it was to be expected: So my perſuaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on concerning you was,
<q>
                        <l>
                           <hi>Si Pergama dextrâ defendi poſſunt, certè hac defenſa videbo.</hi>
                        </l>
                        <l>If <hi>Troy</hi> by any Power could ſtand,</l>
                        <l>'Twould be defended by your hand.</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. For I conceived that among the Champions of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in Reaſon muſt be the beſt, or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual to the beſt, as being by moſt expert Maſters trained up purpoſely for this war, and perpetually practiſed in it. Among the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> I ſaw the Jeſuits would yield the firſt place to none; and Men ſo wiſe in their generation as the Jeſuits were, if they had any <hi>Achilles</hi> among them, I preſumed, would make choice of him for this ſervice. And beſides, I had good aſſurance that in the framing of this building, though you were the only Architect, yet you
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:57896:6"/>wanted not the aſſiſtance of many diligent hands to bring you in choice materials towards it; nor of many careful and watchful eyes to correct the errors of your work, if any ſhould chance to eſcape you. Great reaſon therefore had I to expect great matters from you, and that your Book ſhould have in it the Spirit and Elixir of all that can be ſaid in defence of your Church and Doctrin; and to aſſure my ſelf, that if my reſolution not to believe it, were not built upon the rock of evident grounds and reaſons, but only upon ſome ſandy and deceitful appearances, now the Wind and Storm and Floods were coming, which would undoubtedly overthrow it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Neither truly were you more willing to effect ſuch an alteration in me than I was to have it effected. For my deſire is to go the right way to <hi>Eternal Happineſs.</hi> But whether this way lie on the right-hand or the left, or ſtrait forwards; whether it be by following a living Guide, or by ſeeking my directions in a Book, or by hearkening to the ſecret whiſper of ſome private Spirit, to me it is indifferent. And he that is otherwiſe affected, and has not a Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers indifference, which <hi>Epictetus</hi> requires in all that would find the truth, but much deſires in reſpect of his eaſe, or pleaſure, or profit, or advancement, or ſatisfaction of friends, or any human conſideration, that one way ſhould be true rather than another; it is odds but he will take his deſire that it ſhould be ſo, for an aſſurance that it is ſo. But I for my part, unleſs I deceive my ſelf, was and ſtill am ſo affected as I have made profeſſion: not willing I confeſs to take any thing upon truſt, and to believe it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out asking my ſelf why; no, nor able to command my ſelf (were I never ſo willing) to follow, like a ſheep, every ſhepheard that ſhould take upon him to guide me; or eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Flock that ſhould chance to go before me: but moſt apt and moſt willing to be led by reaſon to any way, or from it; and always ſubmitting all other Reaſons to this one, God hath ſaid ſo, therefore it is true. Nor yet was I ſo unreaſonable as to expect Mathematical demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from you in matters plainly incapable of them, ſuch as are to be <hi>believed,</hi> and if we ſpeak properly, cannot
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:57896:6"/>be <hi>known;</hi> ſuch therefore I expected not. For as he is an unreaſonable Maſter, who requires a ſtronger aſſent to his concluſions than his arguments deſerve; ſo I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him a froward and undiſciplin'd Scholar, who deſires ſtronger arguments for a concluſion than the matter will bear. But had you repreſented to my underſtanding ſuch reaſons of your Doctrine, as being weighed in an even ballance, held by an even hand, with thoſe on the other ſide, would have turned the Scale, and have made your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion more credible than the contrary; certainly I ſhould have deſpiſed the ſhame of one more alteration, and with both mine armes and all my heart moſt readily have embraced it. Such was my expectation from you, and ſuch my preparation, which I brought with me to the reading of your Book.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Would you know now what the event was, what effect was wrought in me by the peruſal and conſideration of it? To deal truly and ingenuouſly with you, I fell ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what in my good opinion both of your ſufficiency and ſincerity: but was exceedingly confirmed in the ill opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Cauſe maintained by you. I found every where Snares that might entrap, and Colours that might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Simple; but nothing that might perſuade, and very little that might move an underſtanding Man, and one that can diſcern between Diſcourſe and Sophiſtry. In ſhort, I was verily perſeaded that I plainly ſaw and could make it appear, to all diſ-paſſionate and unprejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate Judges, that a vein of Sophiſtry and Calumny did run clean through it from the beginning to the end. And this I undertook with a full reſolution to be an adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to your Errors, but a Friend and Servant to your Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: and ſo much the more a Friend to your Perſon, by how much the ſeverer and more rigid Adverſary I was to your Errors.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. In this work, my Conſcience bears me witneſs, that I have according to your advice <hi>proceeded always with this conſideration, that I am to give a moſt ſtrict account of every line, and word that paſſeth under my Pen;</hi> and therefore have been preciſely careful for <hi>the matter</hi> of my Book to defend
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:57896:7"/>truth only, and only by Truth. And then ſcrupulouſly fearful of Scandalizing you or any Man with the <hi>manner</hi> of handling it.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. In your Pamphlet of Directions to <hi>N. N.</hi> you have loaded not only my perſon in particular, but all the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and Moderate Divines of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and all Proteſtants in general, nay all wiſe Men of all Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions but your own, with unworthy Contumelies, and a Maſs of portentous and execrable Calumnies.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. To begin with the laſt, you ſtick not in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of your firſt Chapter, to faſten the imputation <hi>of Atheiſm and Irreligion upon all wiſe and gallant Men, that are not of your own Religion.</hi> In which uncharitable and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian Judgment, void of all colour or ſhadow of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability, I know yet by experience that very many of the <hi>Bigots</hi> of your Faction are partakers with you. God forbid I ſhould think the like of you! Yet if I ſhould ſay, that in your Religion there want not ſome temptations unto, and ſome Principles of Irreligion and Atheiſm, I am ſure I could make my Aſſertion much more probable than you have done, or can make this horrible impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. For to paſs by <hi>firſt,</hi> that which experience juſtifies, that where and when your Religion hath moſt abſolutely commanded, there and then Atheiſm hath moſt abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; To ſay nothing <hi>Secondly,</hi> of your notorious and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed forging of ſo many falſe Miracles, and ſo many lying Legends, which is not unlikely to make ſuſpitious men to queſtion the truth of all: Nor to object to you <hi>Thirdly,</hi> the abundance of your weak and ſilly Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies and ridiculous Obſervances in your Religion, which in all probability cannot but beget ſecret contempt and ſcorn of it in wiſe and conſidering men, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Atheiſm and Impiety, if they have this perſuaſion ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in them (which is too rife among you, and which you account a piece of <hi>Wiſdom and Gallantry</hi>) that if they be not of your Religion, they were as good be of none at all: Nor to trouble you <hi>Fourthly</hi> with this, that a great part of your Doctrine, eſpecially in the Points con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:57896:7"/>makes apparently for the temporal ends of the teachers of it; which yet I fear is a great ſcandal to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Beaux Eſprits</hi> among you: Only I ſhould deſire you to conſider attentively when you conclude ſo often from the differences of Proteſtants, that they have no certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of any part of their Religion, no not of thoſe Points wherein they agree, whether you do not that which ſo magiſterially you direct me not to do, that is, proceed <hi>a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive way, and object arguments againſt your adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, which tend to the overthrow of all Religion?</hi> And whether as you argue thus, <hi>Proteſtants differ in many things, therefore they have no certainty of any thing:</hi> So an Atheiſt or a Sceptick may not conclude as well, Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and the Profeſſors of all Religions differ in many things, therefore they have no certainty of any thing? Again, I ſhould deſire you to tell me ingenuouſly, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be not too probable that your portentous Doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation, joyn'd with your foremention'd per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion of, <hi>No Papiſts no Chriſtians,</hi> hath brought a great many others as well as himſelf, to <hi>Averroes</hi>'s reſolution, <hi>Quandoquidem Chriſtiani adorant quod comedunt, ſit anima mea cum Philoſophis? Foraſmuch as the Chriſtians worſhip that which they eat, let my Soul be with the Philoſophers.</hi> Whether your requiring men upon only probable and <hi>Prudential motives,</hi> to yield a <hi>moſt certain aſſent</hi> unto things in humane reaſon impoſſible, and telling them, as you do too often, that they were as good not believe at all, as believe with any lower degree of Faith, be not a like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly way to make conſidering men ſcorn your Religion, (and conſequently all, if they know no other) as requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring things contradictory, and impoſſible to be perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? Laſtly, Whether your pretence that there is no good ground to believe Scripture, but your Churches infallibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, joyn'd with your pretending no ground for this but ſome Texts of Scripture, be not a fair way to make them that underſtand themſelves, believe neither Church nor Scripture?</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Your Calumnies againſt Proteſtants in general are ſet down in theſe words, Chap. 2. §. 2. <hi>The very doctrine
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:57896:8"/>of Proteſtants, if it be followed cloſely, and with coherence to it ſelf, muſt of neceſſity induce</hi> Socinianiſm. <hi>This I ſay confidently, and evidently prove, by inſtancing in one Error, which may well be termed the Capital and Mother-hereſie, from which all other muſt follow at eaſe; I mean, their Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie in affirming that the perpetual viſible Church of Chriſt, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended by a never interrupted Succeſſion from our Saviour to this day, is not infallible in all that it propoſeth to be believed as revealed truths.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For if the</hi> Infallibility <hi>of ſuch a publick</hi> Authority <hi>be once impeached; what remains, but that every man is given over to his own</hi> wit <hi>and</hi> diſcourſe? <hi>and talk not here of holy Scripture, for if the true Church may err, in defining what Scriptures be Canonical; or in delivering the ſenſe and mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereof, we are ſtill devolved, either upon the</hi> private Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit (<hi>a foolery now exploded out of</hi> England, <hi>which finally leaving every man to his own conceits, ends in</hi> Socinianiſm) <hi>or elſe epon</hi> natural wit <hi>and</hi> judgment, <hi>for examining and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining what Scriptures contain true or falſe Doctrine, and in that reſpect ought to be received or rejected. And indeed, take away the authority of Gods Church, no man can be aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that any one Book or parcel of Scripture was written by Divine Inſpiration; or that all the Contents are infallibly true, which are the direct Errors of</hi> Socinians. <hi>If it were but for this reaſon alone, no man, who regards the eternal ſalvation of his Soul, would live or die in</hi> Proteſtancy, <hi>from which, ſo vaſt abſurdities as theſe of the</hi> Socinians <hi>muſt inevitably follow. And it ought to be an unſpeakable comfort to all us Catholicks, while we conſider, that none can deny the infallible authority of our Church, but jointly he muſt be left to his own wit and ways, and muſt abandon all</hi> infuſed Faith <hi>and true Religion, if he do but underſtand himſelf aright.</hi> In all which Diſcourſe, the only true word you ſpeak, is, <hi>This I ſay confidently:</hi> As for <hi>proving evidently,</hi> that I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve you reſerved for ſome other opportunity: for the preſent I am ſure you have been very ſparing of it.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. You ſay indeed confidently enough, that <hi>the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyal of the Churches infallibility is the Mother-hereſie, from which all other muſt follow at eaſe;</hi> which is ſo far from
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:57896:8"/>being a neceſſary truth, as you make it, that it is indeed a manifeſt falſhood. Neither is it poſſible for the wit of man by any good, or ſo much as probable conſequence, from the denialaof the Churches Infallibility to deduce any one of the ancient Hereſies, or any one Error of the <hi>Socinians,</hi> which are the Hereſies here entreated of: For who would not laugh at him that ſhould argue thus, Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> nor any other Church is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, <hi>Ergo,</hi> The Doctrine of <hi>Arrius, Pelagius, Eutyches, Neſtorius, Photinus, Manichaeus,</hi> was true Doctrine? On the other ſide, it may be truly ſaid, and juſtified by very good and effectual reaſon, that he that affirms with you the Popes Infallibility, puts himſelf into his hands and power to be led by him at his eaſe and pleaſure into all Hereſie, and even to Hell it ſelf, and cannot with reaſon ſay, (ſo long as he is conſtant to his grounds) <hi>Domine cur it a facis?</hi> Sir, <hi>Why do you thus?</hi> but muſt believe <hi>white to be black, and black to be white; vertue to be vice, and vice to be vertue;</hi> nay (which is a horrible, but a moſt certain truth) Chriſt to be Antichriſt, and Antichriſt to be Chriſt, if it be poſſible for the Pope to ſay ſo: Which I ſay and will maintain, howſoever you daub and diſguiſe it, is indeed to make men apoſtate from Chriſt to his pretended Vicar, but real Enemy: For that name, and no better, (if we may ſpeak truth without offence) I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume he deſerves, who under pretence of interpreting the Law of Chriſt, (which Authority, without any word of expreſs warrant, he hath taken upon himſelf) doth in many parts evacuate and diſſolve it: So dethroning Chriſt from his dominion over mens conſciences, and inſtead of Chriſt ſetting up himſelf. In as much as he that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires that his Interpretations of any Law ſhould be obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as true and genuine, ſeem they to mens underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings never ſo diſſonant and diſcordant from it, (as the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> does) requires indeed that <hi>his Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> ſhould be the <hi>Laws;</hi> and he that is firmly prepared in mind to believe and receive all ſuch Interpretations without judging of them, and though to his private judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they ſeem unreaſonable, is indeed congruouſly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:57896:9"/>to hold Adultery a venial ſin, and Fornication no ſin, whenſoever the Pope and his adherents ſhall ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare. And whatſoever he may plead, yet either witting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or ignorantly he makes the Law and the Law-maker both ſtales, and obeys only the Interpreter. As if I ſhould ſubmit to the Laws of the King of <hi>England,</hi> but ſhould indeed reſolve to obey them in that ſence which the King of <hi>France</hi> ſhould put upon them whatſoever it were; I preſume every underſtanding man would ſay that I did indeed obey the King of <hi>France</hi> and not the King of <hi>England.</hi> If I ſhould pretend to believe the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but that I would underſtand it accordingly to the ſenſe which the chief Mufty ſhould put upon it, who would not ſay that I were a Chriſtian in pretence only, but indeed a Mahumetan?</p>
                  <p n="11">11. Nor will it be to purpoſe for you to pretend that the precepts of Chriſt are ſo plain that it cannot be feared, that any Pope ſhould ever go about to diſſolve them and pretend to be a Chriſtian: For, not to ſay that you now pretend the contrary, (to wit), <hi>that the Law of Chriſt is obſcure, even in things neceſſary to be believed and done;</hi> and by ſaying ſo, have made a fair way for any foul interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any part of it: certainly that which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath already done in this kind, is an evident ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, (that if ſhe once had this Power unqueſtioned and made expedite and ready for uſe, by being contracted to the Pope) ſhe may do what ſhe pleaſeth with it. Who that had lived in the Primative Church, would not have thought it as utterly improbable, that ever they ſhould have brought in the Worſhip of Images and Picturing of God, as now it is that they ſhould legitimate Fornication? Why may we not think they may in time take away the whole Communion from the Laity, as well as they have taken away half of it? Why may we not think that any Text and any ſenſe may not be accorded, as well as the whole 14. <hi>Ch.</hi> of the <hi>Ep.</hi> of S. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Corinth.</hi> is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to the Latine ſervice? How is it poſſible any thing ſhould be plainer forbidden, than the <hi>Worſhip of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,</hi> in the <hi>Ep.</hi> to the <hi>Coloſſians?</hi> than <hi>the teaching for Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:57896:9"/>Mens commands</hi> in the Goſpel of <hi>S. Mark?</hi> And therefore ſeeing we ſee theſe things done which hardly any man would have believed, that had not ſeen them, why ſhould we not fear that this unlimited Power may not be uſed hereafter with as little moderation? Seeing devices have been invented how Men may worſhip Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges without Idolatry, and Kill Innocent Men under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Hereſie without Murther, who knows not that ſome tricks may not be hereafter deviſed, by which lying with other Mens Wives ſhall be no Adultery, taking away other Mens Goods no Theft? I conclude therefore, that if <hi>Solomon</hi> himſelf were here, and were to determine the difference, which is more likely to be Mother of all Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, the <hi>denial</hi> of the <hi>Churches,</hi> or the <hi>affirming</hi> of the <hi>Popes Infallibility,</hi> that he would certainly ſay, <hi>this is the Mother, give her the Child.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="12">12. You ſay again confidently, that <hi>if this Infallibility be once impeached, every Man is given over to his own Wit and Diſcourſe:</hi> which, if you mean, <hi>Diſcourſe,</hi> not guiding it ſelfe by Scripture, but only by principles of Nature, or perhaps by prejudices and popular errors, and drawing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences not by rule but chance, is by no means true; if you mean by Diſcourſe, right reaſon, grounded on Divine revelation and common notions, written by God in the hearts of all Men, and deducing, according to the never failing rules of Logick, conſequent deductions from them, if this be it, which you mean by <hi>Diſcourſe,</hi> it is very meet and reaſonable and neceſſary that Men, as in all their actions, ſo eſpecially in that of greateſt importance, the choice of their way to happineſs, ſhould be left unto it: and he that follows this in all his opinions and actions, and does not only ſeem to do ſo, follows alwaies God; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he that followeth a Company of Men, may oftimes follow a Company of Beaſts. And in ſaying this, I ſay no more than S. <hi>John</hi> to all Chriſtians in theſe words, <hi>Dearly beloved, Believe not every ſpirit, but try the ſpirits, whether they be of God, or no:</hi> and the rule he gives them to make this tryal by, is to conſider whether they <hi>confeſs Jeſus to be the Chriſt;</hi> that is, the Guide of their Faith, and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:57896:10"/>Lord of their actions; not whether they acknowledg the <hi>Pope</hi> to be his Vicar: I ſay no more than S. <hi>Paul</hi> in exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all Chriſtians, <hi>to try all things and to hold faſt that which is good;</hi> than S. <hi>Peter</hi> in commanding all Chriſtians, <hi>to be ready to give a reaſon of the hope that is in them:</hi> than <hi>our Saviour</hi> himſelf in forewarning all his followers, that <hi>if they blindly followed blind Guides, both leaders and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers ſhould fall into the Ditch;</hi> and again in ſaying even to the People, <hi>Yea and why of your ſelves Judge ye not what is right?</hi> And though by paſſion, or precipitation, or preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice; by want of Reaſon, or not uſing that they have, Men may be and are oftentimes led into Error and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief; yet that they cannot be miſguided by diſcourſe tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo called, ſuch as I have deſcribed, you your ſelf have given them ſecurity. For what is diſcourſe, but drawing concluſions out of premiſes by good conſequence? Now the principles which we have ſetled, to wit, the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> are on all ſides agreed to be infallibly true. And you have told us in the fourth chap. of this Pamphlet, that <hi>from truth no man can by good conſequence infer falſhood;</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by diſcourſe no Man can poſſibly be led to Error: but if he Err in his concluſions, he muſt of neceſſity either Err in his principles, (which here cannot have place,) or commit ſome Error in his diſcourſe; that is indeed, not diſcourſe but ſeem to do ſo.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. You ſay thirdly, with ſufficient confidence, that <hi>if the true Church may Err in defining what Scriptures be Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical, or in delivering the ſenſe thereof, then we muſt follow either the private Spirit, or elſe natural wit and Judgment, and by them examine what Scriptures contain true or falſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and in that reſpect ought to be received or rejected:</hi> All which is apparently untrue, neither can any proof of it be pretended. For though the preſent Church may poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly Err in her judgment touching this matter, yet have we other Directions in it, beſides the private ſpirit, and the examination of the Contents, (which latter way may conclude the negative very ſtrongly, to wit, that ſuch or ſuch a Book cannot come from God, becauſe it contains irreconcilable contradictions, but the affirmative
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:57896:10"/>it cannot conclude, becauſe the Contents of a Book may be all true, and yet the Book not written by Divine inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration:) other Direction therefore I ſay we have, beſides either of theſe three, and that is, the Teſtimony of the Primitive Chriſtians.</p>

You ſay Fourthly, with convenient boldneſs, That <hi>this infallible Authority of your Church being denied, no man can be aſſured, that any parcel of Scripture was written by Divine inſpiration:</hi> Which is an untruth, for which no proof is pretended, and beſides, void of modeſty and full of impiety. The firſt, becauſe the experience of innumerable Chriſtians is againſt it, who are ſufficiently aſſured, that the Scripture is Divinely inſpired, and yet deny the infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Authority of your Church or any other. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, becauſe if I cannot have ground to be aſſured of the Divine Authority of Scripture, unleſs I firſt believe your Church infallible, then I can have no ground at all to believe it: becauſe there is no ground, nor can any be pretended, why I ſhould believe your Church <hi>Infallible,</hi> unleſs I firſt believe the Scripture Divine.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. Had I a mind to recriminate now, and to charge Papiſts (as you do Proteſtants) that they lead Men to Socinianiſm, I could certainly make a much fairer ſhew of evidence than you have done. For I would not tell you, you deny the Infallibility of the Church of <hi>England, Ergo,</hi> you lead to Socinianiſm, which yet is altogether as good an Argument as this; Proteſtants deny the Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, <hi>Ergo,</hi> they induce Socinia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm: Nor would I reſume my former Argument, and urge you, that by holding the <hi>Popes</hi> Infallibility, you ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit your ſelf to that Capital and Mother Hereſie, by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage whereof, he may lead you at eaſe to believe <hi>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue vice,</hi> and <hi>vice vertue,</hi> to believe Antichriſtianity Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianiſm, and Chriſtianity Antichriſtian; he may lead you to Socinianiſm, to Turciſm, nay, to the Divel himſelf if he have a mind to it: But I would ſhew you that divers ways the Doctors of your Church do the principal and proper work of the Socinians for them, undermining the Doctrine of the Trinity, by denying it to be ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

For the <hi>Dominicans</hi> maintain on the one Side, that <hi>God can foreſee nothing but what he Decrees:</hi> The Jeſuits on the other Side, that <hi>he doth not Decree all things:</hi> And from hence the <hi>Socinians</hi> conclude (as it is obvious for them to do) that <hi>he doth not foreſee all things.</hi> Laſtly, I might adjoyn this, that you agree with one conſent, and ſettle for a rule unqueſtionable, that no part of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion can be repugnant to Reaſon, whereunto you in particular ſubſcribe unawares in ſaying, <hi>From truth no Man can by good conſequence infer falſhood,</hi> which is to ſay in effect, that Reaſon can never lead any Man to Error: And after you have done ſo, you proclaim to all the World (as you in this Pamphlet do very frequently,) that <hi>if Men follow their Reaſon and Diſcourſe,</hi> they will (if they underſtand themſelves) be led to <hi>Socinianiſm.</hi> And thus you ſee with what probable matter I might furniſh out and juſtifie my accuſation, if I ſhould charge you with leading Men to <hi>Socinianiſm!</hi> Yet I do not conceive that I have ground enough for this odious imputation. And much leſs ſhould you have charged <hi>Proteſtants</hi> with it, whom you confeſs to abhor and deteſt it: and who fight againſt it, not with the broken Reeds, and out of the Paper Fortreſſes of an imaginary Infallibility, which were only to make ſport for their Adverſaries; but with the <hi>Sword of the Spirit, the Word of God:</hi> of which we may

                  <p n="20">20. The other Part of your accuſation ſtrikes deeper, and is more conſiderable: And that tells us that, <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiſm waxeth weary of it ſelf; that the Profeſſors of it, they eſpecially of greateſt Worth, Learning, and Authority, love temper and moderation: and are at this time more unreſolved where to faſten, than at the Infancy of their Church:</hi> That <hi>their Churches begin to look with a New Face: Their Walls to Speak a New Language: Their Doctrine to be altered in many things, for which their Progenitors forſook the then

                  <p n="21">21. The truth is, they that run to extreams in oppoſition againſt you, they that pull down your Infallibility and ſet up their own, they that declaim againſt your Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and exerciſe it themſelves over others, are the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries that give you the greateſt advantage, and ſuch as you love to deal with: whereas upon Men of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and moderation, ſuch as will oppoſe nothing becauſe you maintain it, but will draw as near to you, that they

                  <p n="22">22. In which perſwaſion alſo I am much confirmed by conſideration of the Sillineſs and Poorneſs of thoſe ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions, and partly of the apparent vanity and Falſhood of them, which you offer in juſtification of this wicked Calumny. For what if out of Devotion towards God; out of a deſire that He ſhould be Worſhiped as <hi>in Spirit and Truth</hi> in the firſt place, ſo alſo <hi>in the Beauty of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs?</hi> what if out of fear, that too much Simplicity and Nakedneſs in the publick Service of God may beget in the ordinary ſort of Men a dull and ſtupid irreverence, and out of hope that the outward State and Glory of it, being well diſpoſed and wiſely moderated, may ingender, quicken, encreaſe and nouriſh the inward reverence, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and devotion which is due unto Gods Sovereign Majeſty and Power? What if out of a perſuaſion and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire that <hi>Papiſts</hi> may be won over to us the ſooner, by the removing of this Scandal out of their way; and out of an Holy Jealouſie, that the weaker ſort of <hi>Proteſtants</hi> might be the eaſier ſeduced to them by the Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence and Pomp of their Church-ſervice in caſe it were not removed? I ſay, what if out of theſe conſiderations, the Governors of our Church, more of late than former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, have ſet themſelves to adorn and beautifie the places <hi>where Gods Honour dwells,</hi> and to make them as Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as they can with Earthly Ornaments?

                  <p n="23">23. <hi>This one thing J cannot but highly commend in that ſort and Order: They ſpare nothing which either coſt can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form in enriching, or skill in adorning the Temple of God, or to ſet out his Service with the greateſt Pomp and magnificence that can be deviſed. And although, for the moſt part, much Baſeneſs and Childiſhneſs is predominant in the Maſters and contrivers of their Ceremonies, yet this outward State and Glory being well diſpoſed, doth ingender, quicken, increaſe, and nouriſh the inward reverence, reſpect and Devotion, which is due unto Sovereign Majeſty and Power. And although I am not ignorant that many Men well reputed have embraced the thrifty Opinion of that Diſciple, who thought all to be wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted that was beſtowed upon Chriſt in that ſort, and that it were much better beſtowed upon him on the Poor, (yet with an eye perhaps that themſelves would be his quarter Almoners,) notwithſtanding I muſt confeſs, it will never ſink into my Heart, that in proportion of Reaſon, the allowance for furniſhing out of the Service of God ſhould be meaſured by the ſcant and ſtrict rule of meer neceſſity, (a proportion ſo low that Nature to other moſt bountiful in matter of neceſſity, hath not failed no not the moſt ignoble Creatures of the World,) and that for our ſelves no meaſure of heaping but the moſt we can get, no rule of expence but to the utmoſt Pomp we lift: Or that God himſelf had ſo inriched the lower parts of the World with ſuch wonderfull varieties of Beauty and Glory, thut they might ſerve only to the Pampering of Mortal Man in his Pride; and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:57896:14"/>that in the Service of the High Creator Lord and giver, (the outward Glory of whoſe higher Pallace may appear by the very Lamps that we ſee ſo far off Burning gloriouſly in it) only the Simpler, Baſer, Cheaper, Leſs Noble, Leſs Beautiful, Leſs Glorious things ſhould be imployed. Eſpecially ſeeing as in Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces Courts, ſo in the Service of God alſo, this outward State and Glory, being well diſpoſed, doth (as I have ſaid) ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, quicken, increaſe and nouriſh the inward reverence, reſpect and Devotion, which is due to ſo Sovereign Majeſty and Power. Which thoſe whom the uſe thereof cannot perſuade unto, would eaſily by the want of it be brought to confeſs; for which cauſe I crave leave to be excuſed by them herein, if in Zeal to the common Lord of all, I chooſe rather to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the vertue of an Enemy than to flatter the vice and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becility of a Friend.</hi> And ſo much for this matter.</p>

                  <p n="25">25. What if <hi>Proteſtants</hi> be now put in mind, that for expoſition of Scripture, they are bound by a <hi>Canon to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Ancient Fathers:</hi> which whoſoever doth with ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, it is utterly impoſſible he ſhould be a <hi>Papiſt?</hi> And it is moſt falſly ſaid by you, that you know that to ſome <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants</hi> I clcarly demonſtrated, or ever ſo much as under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took, or wentabout to demonſtrate the contrary.

                  <p n="26">26.

Grant this, and it will preſently fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low in oppoſition to your firſt Concluſion, and the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of your firſt Ch: that amongſt men of different opinions, touching the obſcure and controverted Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Religion, ſuch as may with probability be diſputed on both Sides (and ſuch as are the diſputes of <hi>Proteſtants;</hi>) Good men and lovers of truth of all Sides may be ſaved; becauſe all neceſſary things being ſuppoſed evident, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them, with men ſo qualified, there will be no difference: There being no more certain ſign that a Point is not evident, than that honeſt and underſtanding and indifferent men, and ſuch as give themſelves liberty of judgment, after a mature conſideration of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter differ about it.</p>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:57896:16"/>
                  <p n="31">31. Grant this, and it will appear, <hi>Secondly,</hi> that the means whereby the revealed Truths of God are convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to our underſtanding, and which are to determine all Controverſies in Faith, neceſſary to be determined, may be, for any thing you have ſaid to the contrary, not a Church but the Scripture; which contradicts the Doctrine of your <hi>Second Chapter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="32">32. Grant this, and the diſtinction of points Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental and not Fundamental, will appear very good and pertinent. For thoſe truths will be Fundamental, which are evidently delivered in Scripture, and commanded to be Preached to all men; Thoſe not Fundamental which are obſcure. And nothing will hinder, but that the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church may Err in the latter kind of the ſaid points: becauſe Truths not neceſſary to the Salvation, cannot be neceſſary to the being of a Church; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is not abſolutely neceſſary that God ſhould aſſiſt his Church any farther than to bring Her to Salvation; neither will there be any neceſſity at all of any Infallible Guide, either to conſign unwritten Traditions, or to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the obſcurities of the Faith. Not for the former end, be cauſe this Principle being granted true, nothing unwritten can be neceſſary to be conſigned. Nor for the latter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe nothing that is obſcure can be neceſſary to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, or not miſtaken. And ſo the diſcourſe of your whole <hi>Third Chap:</hi> will preſently vaniſh.</p>
                  <p n="33">33. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> for the Creed's containing the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals of ſimple belief, though I ſee not how it may be deduced from this principle, yet the granting of this plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly renders the whole diſpute touching the Creed neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. For if all neceſſary things of all ſorts, whether of ſimple belief or practice be confeſſed to be clearly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in Scripture, what imports it whether thoſe of one ſort be contained in the Creed?</p>
                  <p n="34">34. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> let this be granted, and the immediate Corollary in oppoſition to your Fifth Chap. will be and muſt be, That, not Proteſtants for rejecting, but the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> for impoſing upon the Faith of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Doctrines unwritten and unneceſſary, and for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbing
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:57896:16"/>the Churches Peace, and dividing Unity for ſuch matters, is in a high degree preſumptuous and Schiſmatical.</p>
                  <p n="35">35. Grant this, <hi>ſixthly,</hi> and it will follow unavoidably that <hi>Proteſtants</hi> cannot poſſibly be Hereticks, ſeeing they believe all things evidently contained in Scripture, which are ſuppoſed to be all that is neceſſary to be believed: and ſo your <hi>Sixth Chapter</hi> is clearly confuted.</p>
                  <p n="36">36. Grant this Laſtly, and it will be undoubtedly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent, in contradiction of your <hi>Seventh Chapter,</hi> that no Man can ſhew more Charity to himſelf than by contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing a <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> ſeeing <hi>Proteſtants</hi> are ſuppoſed to believe, and therefore may accordingly practice, at leaſt by their Religion are not hindered from practiſing and performing all things neceſſary to Salvation.</p>
                  <p n="37">37. So that the poſition of this one Principle, is the direct overthrow of your whole Book, and therefore I needed not, nor indeed have I made uſe of any other. Now this principle, which is not only the Corner-ſtone or chief Pillar, but even the baſe, and adequate Foundation of my Anſwer; and which while it ſtands firm and unmov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, cannot but be the ſupporter of my Book, and the certain ruin of yours, is ſo far from being, according to your pretence, deteſted by all <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> that all <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants</hi> whatſoever, as you may ſee in their Harmony of Confeſſions, unanimouſly profeſs and maintain it. And you your ſelf, C. 6. § 30. plainly confeſs as much, in ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>The whole Edifice of the Faith of</hi> Proteſtants <hi>is ſetled on theſe two Principles: Theſe particular Books are Canonical Scripture: And the ſenſe and meaning of them is plain and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident at leaſt in all points neceſsary to Salvation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="38">38. And thus your Venom againſt me is in a manner ſpent, ſaving only that there remain two little imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nences, whereby you would diſable me from being a fit advocate for the cauſe of <hi>Proteſtants.</hi> The firſt, becauſe I refuſe to ſubſcribe the Artic. of the Ch. of <hi>England:</hi> The ſecond, becauſe I have ſet down in writing, motives which ſometime induced me to forſake Proteſtantiſm, and hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto have not anſwered them.</p>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:57896:17"/>
                  <p n="39">39. By the former of which objections it ſhould ſeem, that either you conceive the 39 Articles the common Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of all Proteſtants, and if they be, why have you ſo often upbraided them with-their many and great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences? Or elſe that it is the peculiar defence of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and not the common cauſe of all <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> which is here undertaken by me: which are certainly ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry groſs miſtakes. And yet, why he who makes ſcruple of ſubſcribing the truth of one or two Propoſitions, may not yet be fit enough to maintain, that thoſe who do ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe them, are in a ſaveable condition, I do not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand. Now though I hold not the Doctrine of all <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants</hi> abſolutely true, (which with reaſon cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of me while they hold contradictions,) yet I hold it free from all impiety, and from all Error deſtructive of Salvation, or in it ſelf damnable: And this I think in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon may ſufficiently qualifie me, for a maintainer of this aſſertion, that <hi>Proteſtancy deſtroys not Salvation.</hi> For the Church of <hi>England,</hi> I am perſuaded that the conſtant Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of it is ſo pure and Orthodox, that whoſoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves it and lives according to it, undoubtedly he ſhall be ſaved; and that there is no Error in it which may neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitate or warrant any Man to diſturb the peace or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the Communion of it. This in my opinion is all intended by Subſcription, and thus much if you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive me not ready to ſubſcribe, your <hi>Charity</hi> I aſſure you is much <hi>miſtaken.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="40">40. Your other Objection is yet more impertinent and frivolous than the former: Unleſs perhaps it be a juſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception againſt a Phyſitian, that himſelf was ſometimes in, and recovered himſelf from that Diſeaſe which he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes to cure; or againſt a Guide in a way, that at firſt before he had experience, himſelf miſtook it, and afterwards found his error and amended it. That noble writer <hi>Michael de Montai'gne,</hi> was ſurely of a far different mind; for he will hardly allow any Phyſitian competent, but only for ſuch Diſeaſes as himſelf had paſſed through: And a far greater than <hi>Montai'gne,</hi> even he that ſaid, <hi>Tu converſus confirma fratres, when thou art converted, ſtrengthen
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:57896:17"/>by Brethren,</hi> gives us ſufficiently to underſtand, that they which have themſelves been in ſuch a ſtate as to need Converſion, are not thereby made incapable of, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther engaged and obliged unto, and qualified for this Charitable Function.</p>
                  <p n="41">41. The Motives then, hitherto not anſwered, were theſe.</p>
                  <p n="42">42. <hi>I. Becauſe perpetual viſible profeſſion, which could never be wanting to the Religion of Chriſt, nor any part of it, is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently wanting to</hi> Proteſtant <hi>Religion, ſo far as concerns the points in conteſtation.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe are the Motives; now my Anſwers to them fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low briefly and in order.</p>
                  <p n="43">43. To the firſt: God hath neither drecreed nor fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told, that his true Doctrine ſhould <hi>de facto</hi> be alwaies vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly profeſſed, without any mixture of falſhood.</p>
                  <p>To the ſecond: God hath neither decreed nor fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told, that there ſhall be alwaies a viſible Company of Men free from all Error in it ſelf Damnable. Neither is it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies of neceſſity Schiſmatical to ſeparate from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Communion of a Church, though wanting nothing neceſſary: For if this Church ſuppoſed to want nothing neceſſary, require me to profeſs againſt my Conſcience, that I believe ſome Error, tho never ſo ſmall and inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, which I do not believe, and will not allow me Her Communion, but upon this condition: In this caſe, the Church for requiring this condition is Schiſmatical, and not I for ſeparating from the Church.</p>
                  <p>To the third: If any credit may be given to Records far more creditable than theſe, the Doctrine of <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> that is, the Bible hath been confirmed, and the Doctrine of <hi>Papiſts,</hi> which is in many points plainly oppoſite to it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded with Supernatural and Divine Miracles, which for number and Glory, out-ſhine <hi>Popiſh</hi> pretended Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, as much as the Sun doth an <hi>Ignis fatuus,</hi> thoſe I mean which were wrought by our Saviour Chriſt and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles:
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:57896:18"/>Now this Book, by the Confeſſion of all ſides confirmed by innumerous Miracles, foretels me plainly, that in after Ages, great Signs and Wonders ſhall be wrought in confirmation of falſe Doctrine, and that I am not to believe any Doctrine which ſeems to my underſtanding repugnant to the firſt, though an Angel from Heaven ſhould teach it; which were certainly as great a Miracle as any that was ever wrought in atteſtation of any part of the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> But that true Doctrine ſhould in all Ages have the teſtimony of Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, that I am no where taught; So that I have more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to ſuſpect and be afraid of pretended Miracles, as ſigns of falſe Doctrine, then much to regard them as certain arguments of the truth. Beſides, ſetting aſide the Bible, and the Tradition of it, there is as good ſtory for Miracles wrought by thoſe who lived and died in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Doctrine of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, (as by S. <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian, Colmannus, Columbanus, Aidanus</hi> and others,) as there is for thoſe that are pretended to be wrought by the Members of that Church. Laſtly, it ſeems to me no ſtrange thing, that God in his Juſtice ſhould permit ſome true Miracles to be wrought to delude them, who have forged ſo many, as apparently the Profeſſors of the <hi>Roman</hi> Doctrine have to abuſe the World.</p>
                  <p>To the Fourth: All thoſe were not
<note n="a" place="margin">See this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by Bellar: <hi>de Scrip: Eccleſ. in Philaſtrio:</hi> by <hi>Petavius Animad. in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piph. de in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrip. operis:</hi> By S. Auſtin. <hi>Lib. de Hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſ. Haer.</hi> 80.</note> Hereticks which by <hi>Philaſtrius, Epiphanius,</hi> or S. <hi>Auſtine</hi> were put in the Catalogue of Hereticks.</p>
                  <p>To the Fifth: Kings and Nations have been, and may be Converted by Men of contrary Religions.</p>
                  <p>To the Sixth: The Doctrine of <hi>Papiſts,</hi> is confeſſed by <hi>Papiſts</hi> contrary to the Fathers in many points.</p>
                  <p>To the Seventh: The Paſtors of a Church cannot but have Authority from it, to Preach againſt the abuſes of it, whether in Doctrine or Practice, if there be any in it: Neither can any Chriſtian want an ordinary commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from God to do a neceſſary work of Charity after a peacable manner, when there is no body elſe that can or will do it. In extraordinary caſes, extraordinary cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are not to be diſallowed. If ſome Chriſtian Lay-man
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:57896:19"/>ſhould come into a Country of Infidels, and had ability to perſuade them to Chriſtianity, who would ſay he might not uſe it for want of Commiſſion!</p>
                  <p>To the Eighth: <hi>Luthers</hi> conference with the Devil might be, for ought I know, nothing but a Melancholy Dream: If it were real, the Devil might perſuade <hi>Luther</hi> from the Maſs, hoping by doing ſo to keep him conſtant to it: Or that others would make his diſſuaſion from it an argument for it, (as we ſee <hi>Papiſts</hi> do) and be afraid of following <hi>Luther,</hi> as confeſſing himſelf to have been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded by the Devil.</p>
                  <p>To the Ninth: <hi>Illiacos intra muros peccatur &amp; extra. Papiſts</hi> are more guilty of this fault than <hi>Proteſtants.</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven this very Author in this very Pamphlet, hath not ſo many leaves as falſifications and Calumnies.</p>
                  <p>To the Tenth: Let all Men believe the Scripture and that only, and endeavour to believe it in the true ſenſe, and require no more of others, and they ſhall find this not only a better, but the only means to ſuppreſs Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, and reſtore Unity. For he that believes the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſincerely, and endeavours to believe it in the true ſenſe, cannot poſſibly be an Heretick: And if no more than this were required of any Man, to make him capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the Churches Communion, then all Men ſo quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, though they were different in opinion, yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding any ſuch difference, muſt be of neceſſity one in Communion.</p>

If beginnings be ominous (as they ſay they are,) D. <hi>Potter</hi> hath cauſe to look for great ſtore of uningenuous dealing from you; the very firſt words you ſpeak of him, <hi>viz. That he hath not ſo much as once truly and really fallen upon the point in queſtion,</hi> being a moſt unjuſt and immodeſt imputation.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. For the point in queſtion was not that which you pretend, <hi>Whether both</hi> Papiſts <hi>and</hi> Proteſtants <hi>can be ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their ſeveral Profeſſions?</hi> But, <hi>whether you may with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out uncharitableneſs affirm that Proteſtancy unrepented deſtroys Salvation?</hi> For there is no incongruity but that it may be true, <hi>That you and we connot both be Saved:</hi> and yet as Ttrue, <hi>That without uncharitableneſs you cannot pronounce us Damned.</hi> And therefore though the Author of <hi>Charity Miſtaken</hi> had proved as ſtrongly as he hath done weakly, <hi>that one Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven could not receive</hi> Proteſtants <hi>and</hi> Papiſts <hi>both,</hi> yet cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, it was very haſtily and unwarrantably, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore uncharitably concluded, that <hi>Proteſtants</hi> were the part that was to be excluded. As, though Jews and Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans cannot both be ſaved, yet a Jew cannot juſtly, and therefore not charitably pronounce a Chriſtian Damned.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Neither may you or <hi>C. M.</hi> conclude him from hence (as covertly you do,) <hi>an Enemy to Souls by deceiving them with ungrounded falſe hopes of Salvation;</hi> ſeeing the hope of Salvation cannot be ungrounded, which requires and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes belief and practiſe of all things abſolutely neceſſary
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:57896:20"/>to Salvation, and repentance of thoſe Sins and Errors which we fall into by humane frailty: Nor a <hi>friend to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency in Religions,</hi> ſeeing he gives them only hope of pardon of Errors who are deſirous, and according to the proportion of their opportunities and abilities induſtrious to find the truth, or at leaſt truly repentant, that they have not been ſo. Which Doctrine is very fit to excite men to a conſtant and impartial ſearch of truth, and very far from teaching them, that it is indifferent what Religion they are of, and without all controverſie very honourable to the goodneſs of God, with which how it can conſiſt, not to be ſatisfied with his Servants true endeavours to know his will and do it, without full and exact performance, I leave it to you and all good men to judge.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. You ſay <hi>he was loth to affirm plainly, that generally both</hi> Catholicks <hi>and</hi> Proteſtants <hi>may be ſaved:</hi> which yet is manifeſt he doth affirm plainly, of <hi>Proteſtants</hi> through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his Book; and of Erring <hi>Papiſts,</hi> that have <hi>ſincerely ſought the truth and failed of it, and Die with a generalrepentance:</hi> p. 77.78. And yet you deceive your ſelf, if you conveive he had any other neceſſity to do ſo, but only that he thought it true. For we may and do pretend that before Luther <hi>there were many true Churches, beſides the</hi> Roman, which agreed not with her: in particular, <hi>The Greek Church.</hi> So that what you ſay is evidently true, is indeed evidently falſe. Beſides if he had had any neceſſity to make uſe of you in this matter, he needed not for this end to ſay that now in your Church, Salvation may be had; but onely that before <hi>Luthers</hi> time it might be: Then when your means of knowing the truth were not ſo great, and when your ignorance might be more invincible, and therefore more excuſable. So that you may ſee if you pleaſe, it is not for ends, but for the love of truth, that we are thus charitable to you.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Neither is it material what you alledge, that they are not <hi>Fundamental Errors,</hi> and then, <hi>what imports it whether we hold them or no, foraſmuch as concerns cur poſſibility to be Saved.</hi> As if we were not bound by the Love of God and the love of truth, to be zealous in the defence of all
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:57896:20"/>Truths, that are any way profitable, though not ſimply neceſſary to Salvation. Or as if any good man could ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie his Conſcience with being ſo affected and reſolved. Our Saviour himſelf having aſſured us, <hi rend="sup">a</hi> That <hi>he that ſhall break one of his leaſt Commandments</hi> (ſome whereof you pretend are concerning venial ſins, and conſequently the keeping of them not neceſſary to Salvation) <hi>and ſhall ſo teach men, ſhall be called the leaſt in the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi>

But then it imports very much, though not for the <hi>poſſibility that you may be ſaved,</hi> yet for the <hi>probability that you will be ſo:</hi> becauſe the holding of theſe Errors, though it did not <hi>merit,</hi> migh yet <hi>occaſion</hi> Damnation. As the Doctrine of Indulgences may take away the fear of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory, and the Doctrine of Purgatory the fear of Hell; as you well know it does too frequently. So that though a godly man might be ſaved <hi>with theſe</hi> Errors, yet by <hi>means of them,</hi> many are made vicious and ſo damned. <hi>By them</hi> I ſay, though <hi>not for them.</hi> No godly Lay-man who is verily perſuaded that there is neither impiety nor ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition in the uſe of your Latin Service, ſhall be Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, I hope, for being preſent at it; yet the want of that Devotion which the frequent hearing the Offices under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, might happily beget in them, the want of that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction and edification which it might afford them, may very probably hinder the Salvation of many which otherwiſe might have been ſaved. Beſides, though the matter of an Error may be only ſomething profitable, not neceſſary, yet the neglect of it may be a damnable Sin. As not to regard Venial Sins is in the Doctrine of your Schools, mortal. Laſtly, as Venial Sins, you ſay, diſpoſe men to mortal; ſo the erring from ſome profitable, though leſſer truth, may diſpoſe a man to Error in greater matters. As for example: The Belief of the <hi>Popes</hi> Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility is, I hope, not unpardonably damnable to every one that holds it; yet if it be a falſhood (as moſt certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is) it puts a man into a very congruous diſpoſition to believe <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> if he ſhould chance to get into that See.</p>

                        <hi>It ſeems Fundamental to the Faith, and for the Salvation of every member of the Church, that he acknowledge and believe all ſuch points of Faith, as whereof he may be convinced that they belong to the Doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>

                     <q>To this conviction he requires three things. <hi>Clear Revelation; Sufficient Propoſition, and Capacity and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding in the hearer. For want of clear Revelation, he frees the Church before Chriſt and the Diſciples of Chriſt from any damnable Error, though they believed not thoſe things which he that ſhould now deny were no Chriſtian. To ſufficient Propoſition, he requires two things.</hi> 1. <hi>That the points be perſpicuouſly laid open in themſelves.</hi> 2. <hi>So forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, as may ſerve to remove reaſonable doubts to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and to ſatisfie a teachable mind concerning it, againſt the Principles in which he hath been bred to the contrary. This Propoſition he ſays is not limited to the</hi> Pope <hi>or Church, but extended to all means whatſoever, by which a man may be convinced in Conſcience, that the matter propoſed is Divine Revelation; which he profeſſes to be done ſufficiently, not
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:57896:21"/>only when his Conſcience doth expreſly bear witneſs to the truth; but when it would do ſo, if it were not choaked, and blinded by ſome unruly and unmortified luſt in the will.

                  <p>Again, it is almoſt as ſtrange to me, why you ſhould ſay, this was the only thing in queſtion, <hi>Whether a Man may deny or disbelieve any point of Faith, ſufficiently preſented to his underſtanding as a truth revealed by God.</hi> For to ſay, that any thing is a thing in queſtion, methinks at the firſt hearing of the words, imports, that it is by ſome affirmed, and denied by others. Now you affirm I grant, but what <hi>Proteſtant</hi> ever denied, that it was a ſin to give God the lie? Which is the firſt and moſt obvious ſenſe of theſe Words. Or which of them ever doubted, that to disbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve is then a fault, when the matter is ſo propoſed to a Man, that he might and ſhould, and were it not for his own fault, would believe it? Certainly he that queſtions either of theſe, juſtly deſerves to have his wits called in queſtion.

But then I muſt tell you, that your enſuing Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, viz: <hi>To deny a truth witneſſed by God is damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, But of two that diſagree, one muſt of neceſſity deny ſome ſuch truth, Therefore one only can be ſaved;</hi> is built upon a ground clean different from this poſtulate. For though it be always a fault to deny what either I do know, or ſhould know, to be teſtified by God; yet that which by a
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:57896:22"/>cleanly conveyance you put in the place hereof, <hi>To deny a Truth witneſſed by God</hi> ſimply, without the circumſtance of <hi>being known or ſufficienly propoſed,</hi> is ſo far from being certainly Damnable, that it may be many times done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any the leaſt fault at all. As if God ſhould teſtifie ſomething to a man in the <hi>Indies,</hi> I that had no aſſurance of this teſtification ſhould not be obliged to believe it. For in ſuch caſes the Rule of the Law has place, <hi>Idem eſt non eſſe &amp; non apparere:</hi> not to be at all and not to appear to me, is to me all one. <hi>If I had not come and ſpoken unto you</hi> (ſaith our Saviour) <hi>you had had no ſin.</hi>

                  <p n="10">10. As little neceſſity is there for that which follows: <hi>That of two diſagreeing in a matter of Faith one muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſome ſuch truth.</hi> Whether by [ſuch] you underſtand, <hi>Teſtified at all by God;</hi> or <hi>teſtified and ſufficiently propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> For it is very poſſible the matter in controverſie may be ſuch a thing wherein God hath not at all declared him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, or not ſo fully and clearly as to oblige all Men to hold one way; and yet be ſo overvalued by the parties in variance, as to be eſteemed a matter <hi>of Faith,</hi> and one of thoſe things of which our Saviour ſays, <hi>He that believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not ſhall be Damned.</hi> Who ſees not that it is poſſible two Churches may excommunicate and Damn each other for keeping <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> Ten days ſooner or later; as well as <hi>Victor</hi> excommunicated the Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> for dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering from him about <hi>Eaſter-Day?</hi> And yet I believe you will confeſs, that God had not then declared him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf about <hi>Eaſter;</hi> nor hath now about <hi>Chriſtmas.</hi> Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently ſome good Catholick Biſhops excommunicated and Damned others for <hi>holding there were Antipodes:</hi> and in this queſtiom I would fain know on which ſide was the ſufficient propoſal. <hi>The contra-Remonſtrants</hi> differ from the <hi>Remonſtrants</hi> about the points of Predeterminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as a matter of Faith: I would know in this thing alſo, which way God hath declared himſelf; whether for Predetermination or againſt it. <hi>Stephen Biſhop of</hi> Rome held it as a matter of Faith and Apoſtolick tradition, <hi>That Hereticks gave true Baptiſm:</hi> Others there were, and they as good Catholicks as he, that held that this was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther matter of <hi>Faith</hi> nor matter of <hi>Truth. Juſtin Martyr</hi>
                     <pb n="35" facs="tcp:57896:22"/>and <hi>Irenaeus</hi> held the Doctrine of the <hi>Millenaries</hi> as a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Faith:</hi> and though <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> deny it, yet you, I hope, will affirm, that ſome good Chriſtians held the contrary. S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> I am ſure, held <hi>the communicating of Infants,</hi> as much Apoſtolick tradition, as the Baptiſing of them: whether the Biſhop and the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> of his time, held ſo too, or held otherwiſe, I deſire you to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine. But, ſure I am, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> at this preſent holds the contrary. The ſame S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> held it no matter of Faith, that the <hi>Biſhops of</hi> Rome <hi>were Judges of Appeals</hi> from all parts of the Church Catholick, no not in <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor Cauſes and Major Perſons:</hi> whether the Biſhop or Church of <hi>Rome</hi> did then hold the contrary do you reſolve me; but now I am reſolved they do ſo. In all theſe dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences, the point in queſtion is eſteemed and propoſed by one ſide at leaſt as a matter of <hi>Faith,</hi> and by the other rejected as not ſo: and either this is to diſagree in matters of Faith, or you will have no means to ſhew that we do diſagree. Now then to ſhew you how weak and ſandy the Foundation is, on which the whole Fabrick both of your Book and Church depends, anſwer me briefly to this <hi>Dilemma.</hi> Either in theſe oppoſitions one of the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite Parts erred damnably, and denied Gods truth ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently propounded or they did not. If they did, than they which do deny Gods truth ſufficiently propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, may go to heaven; and then you are raſh and uncharitable in excluding us, though we were guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of this fault. If not, then there is no ſuch neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, that of two diſagreeing about a matter of Faith, one ſhould deny Gods truth ſufficiently propounded. And ſo the Major and Minor of your Argument, are proved falſe. Yet, though they were as true as Goſpel, and as evident as Mathematical Principles, the concluſion (ſo impertinent is it to the Premiſes) might ſtill be falſe. For that which naturally iſſues from theſe propoſitions is not. <hi>Therefore one only can be ſaved:</hi> But, <hi>Therefore one of them does ſomething that is damnable.</hi> But with what Logick or what Charity you can infer either as the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate production of the former premiſes, or as a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rollary from this concluſion, Therefore <hi>one only can be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,</hi>
                     <pb n="36" facs="tcp:57896:23"/>I do not underſtand; unleſs you will pretend that this conſequence is good, ſuch a one doth ſomething damnable, therefore he ſhall certainly be damned: which whether it be not to overthrow the Article of our Faith, which promiſes remiſſion of ſins upon repentance, and conſequently to ruin the Goſpel of Chriſt, I leave it to the <hi>Pope</hi> and the <hi>Cardinals</hi> to determine. For if againſt this it be alledged, that no man can repent of the ſin wherein he Dies: This muce I have already ſtopped, by ſhewing that if it be a ſin of Ignorance, this is no way incongruous.</p>
                  <p n="13">13.

For though you ſay that Chriſt hath promiſed there ſhall be a Perpetual Viſible Church; yet you your ſelves do not pretend that he hath promiſed there ſhall be Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and Records always extant of the Profeſſors of it in
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:57896:23"/>all Ages: nor that he hath any where enjoyned us to read thoſe Hiſtories that we may be able to ſhew them.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. To your enſuing demands, though ſome of them be very captious and enſnaring; yet I will give you as clear and plain and Ingenuous Anſwers as poſſibly I can.</p>
                  <p n="18">18. Ad 11. §.] To the Firſt then, about <hi>the Perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuity of the viſible Church,</hi> my Anſwer is: That I believe our Saviour, ever ſince his Aſcenſion, hath had in ſome place or other a Viſible true Church on Earth: I mean a Company of Men, that profeſſed at leaſt ſo much truth as was abſolutely neceſſary for their Salvation. And I believe that there will be ſomewhere or other ſuch a Church to the Worlds end. But the contrary Doctrine I do at no hand believe to be a damnable Hereſie.</p>
                  <p n="19">19. Ad 12. §.] To the Second, what <hi>Viſible Church there was before</hi> Luther <hi>diſagreeing from the</hi> Roman? I anſwer, that before <hi>Luther</hi> there were many Viſible Churches in many things diſagreeing from the <hi>Roman:</hi> But not that the whole Catholick Church diſagreed from Her, becauſe She her ſelf was a Part of the Whole, though much corrupted. And to undertake to name a Catholick Church diſagreeing from Her, is to make her no Part of it, which we do not, nor need not pretend. And <hi>for men agreeing with</hi> Proteſtants <hi>in all points,</hi> we will then produce them, when you ſhall either prove it neceſſary to be done, which you know we abſolutely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; or when you ſhall produce a perpetual ſucceſſion of Profeſſors, which in all points have agreed with you, and diſagreed from you in nothing. But this my promiſe, to deal plainly with you, I conceive, and ſo intended it to be very like his, who undertook to drink up the Sea, upon condition, that he, to whom the promiſe was made, ſhould firſt ſtop the Rivers from runing in. For this unreaſonable requeſt which you make to us is to your ſelves ſo impoſſible, that in the very next Age after the Apoſtles, you will never be able to name a Man, whom you can prove to have agreed with you in all things, nay (if you ſpeak of ſuch, whoſe Works are extant and unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned) whom we cannot prove to have diſagreed from
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:57896:24"/>you in many things. Which I am ſo certain of, that I will venture my Credit, and my Life upon it.</p>
                  <p n="20">20. Ad 13. §.] To the Third, <hi>Whether, ſeeing there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be aſſigned any Viſible true Church diſtinct from the</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, <hi>it follows not that She Erred not Fundamentally.</hi> I ſay, in our ſenſe of the word <hi>Fundamental,</hi> it does follow. For if it be true, that there was then no Church di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct from the <hi>Roman,</hi> then it muſt be, either becauſe there was no Church at all, which we deny: Or becauſe the <hi>Roman</hi> Church was the whole Church, which we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo deny: Or becauſe She was a Part of the Whole, which we grant. And if She were a true Part of the Church than She retained thoſe truths which were ſimply neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to Salvation, and held no Errors which were inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly and unpardonably deſtructive of it. For this is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely neceſſary to conſtitute any man or any Church a member of the Church Catholick. In our ſenſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of the Word <hi>Fundamental,</hi> I hope She erred not Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentally: but in your ſenſe of the word, I fear ſhe did. That is, She held ſomething to be Divine Revelation, which was not; ſomething not to be which was.</p>
                  <p n="21">21. Ad 14. §.] To the Fourth. <hi>How it could be damnable to maintain her Errors, if they were not Fundamental?</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. 1. Though it were not damnable, yet if it were a fault, it was not to be done. For a Venial ſin, with you is not damnable; yet you ſay, it is not to be committed for the procuring any good. <hi>Non eſt faciendum malum vel minimum, ut eveniat bonum vel maximum.</hi> 2. It is dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to maintain an error againſt Conſcience, though the error in it ſelf, and to him that believes it, be not damnable. Nay, the profeſſion not only of an error, but even of a truth, if not believed, when you think on it again, I believe you will confeſs to be a mortal ſin; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs you will ſay, Hypocriſie and Simulation in Religion is not ſo. 3. Though we ſay, the Errors of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church were not deſtructive of Salvation, but pardona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble even to them that Dyed in them, upon a general re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance: yet we deny not but in <hi>themſelves they were damnable.</hi> Nay, the very ſaying they were pardonable,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:57896:24"/>implies they needed pardon, and therefore in themſelves were damnable: damnable <hi>meritoriouſly,</hi> though not <hi>effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually.</hi> As a poyſon may be deadly in it ſelf, and yet not kill him, that together with the Poyſon takes an Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dote: or as Fellony may deſerve Death, and yet not bring it on him that obtains the Kings Pardon.</p>
                  <p n="22">22. Ad 15. §] To the Fifth. <hi>How they can be excuſed from Schiſm, who forſook her Communion upon pretence of Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors which were not damnable!</hi> I anſwer. All that we forſake in you, is only the Belief, and Practice, and profeſſion of your Errors. Hereupon, you caſt us out of your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion. And then with a ſtrange, and contradictious and ridiculous Hypocriſie, complain that we forſake it. As if a man ſhould thruſt his friend out of doors, and then be offended at his departure. But for us not to forſake the belief of your Errors, having diſcovered them to be Errors, was impoſſible; and therefore to do ſo could not be damnable, believing them to be Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors. Not to forſake the practice and profeſſion of them, had been damnable Hereſie; ſuppoſing that (which you vainly run away with, and take for granted) thoſe Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors in themſelves were not damnable. Now to do ſo, and as matters now ſtand, not to forſake your Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, is apparently contradictious: ſeeing the condition of your Communion is, that we muſt profeſs to believe all your Doctrines, not only not to be damnable Errors (which will not content you,) but alſo to be certain and neceſſary and revealed truths. So that to demand why we forſake your Communion upon pretence of Errors which were not damnable, is in effect to demand why we forſook it upon our forſaking it! For to pretend that there are Errors in your Church though not damnable, is <hi>ipſo facto</hi> to forſake your Communion, and to do that which both in your account, and as you thin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> in Gods account, puts him as does ſo, out of your Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. So that either you muſt free your Church from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring the belief of any Error whatſoever, damnable and not damnable, or whether you will or no, you muſt free us from Schiſm. For Schiſm there cannot be in
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:57896:25"/>leaving your Communion, unleſs we were obliged to continue in it. Man cannot be obliged by Man, but to what either formally or virtually he is obliged by God, for all juſt power is from God. God the Eternal truth neither can nor will oblige us to believe any the leaſt and the moſt innocent falſhood to be a Divine truth, that is, to Err; nor, to profeſs a known Error, which is to lie. So that if you require the belief of any Error among the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of your Communion, our obligation to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate with you ceaſeth, and ſo the imputation of Schiſm to us, vaniſheth into nothing: but lies heavy upon you for making our ſeparation from you juſt and neceſſary, by requiring unneceſſary and unlawful conditions of your Communion. Hereafter therefore, I intreat you, let not your demand be, how could we forſake your Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion without Schiſm, ſeeing you Erred not damnably? But how we could do ſo without Schiſm, ſeeing you Erred not at all? which if either you do prove, or we cannot diſprove it, we will (I at leaſt will for my part) return to your Communion, or ſubſcribe my ſelf Schiſmatick. In the mean time, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, we continue where we are.</p>
                  <p n="23">23. Yet notwithſtanding all your Errors we do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce your Communion <hi>totally</hi> and abſolutely, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly leave Communicating with you in the practice and profeſſion of your Errors. The tryal whereof will be to propoſe ſome form of worſhiping God, taken wholly out of Scripture; and herein if we refuſe to joyn with you, then, and not till then, may we juſtly ſay we have utterly and abſolutely abandoned your Communion.</p>
                  <p n="25">25. Ad 17. §.] To the Seventh, <hi>Whether Error againſt any one truth ſufficiently propounded as teſtified by God, deſtroy not the Nature and Unity of Faith, or at leaſt, is not a grievous <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ffence excluding Salvation!</hi> I anſwer, if you ſuppoſe, as you ſeem to do the propoſition ſo ſufficient, that the party to whom it is made is convinced that it is from God, ſo that the denyal of it involves alſo with it the denial of Gods veracity; any ſuch Error deſtroys both Faith and Salvation. But if the Propoſal be only ſo
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:57896:25"/>ſufficient, not, that the party to whom it is made is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, but only that he ſhould, and but for his own fault would have been convinced of the Divine verity of the Doctrine propoſed: The crime then is not ſo great, for the belief of Gods veracity may well conſiſt with ſuch an Error. Yet a fault I confeſs it is and (without Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance) damnable, if all circumſtances conſidered the propoſal be ſufficient. But then I muſt tell you that the propoſal of the preſent <hi>Roman</hi> Church is only pretended to be ſufficient for this purpoſe, but is not ſo: eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all the Rayes of the Divinity, which they pretend to ſhine ſo conſpicuouſly in her propoſals, being ſo darkn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and even extinguiſhed with a cloud of contradiction, from Scripture, Reaſon, and the Ancient Church.</p>

Ad 18. §.] To the Eighth. <hi>How of diſagreeing</hi> Proteſtants, <hi>both parts may hope for Salvation, ſeeing ſome of them muſt needs Err againſt ſome Truth teſtified by God?</hi> I anſwer, 1. The moſt diſagreeing <hi>Proteſtants</hi> that are, yet thus far agree, that theſe Books of Scripture which were never doubted of in the Church, are the undoubted Word of God, and a perfect rule of Faith. 2. That the ſenſe of them, which God intended, whatſoever it is, is certainly true. So that they believe implicitely even thoſe very truths againſt which they Err; and why an impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit Faith in Chriſt and his Word, ſhould not ſuffice as well as an implicit Faith in your Church, I have deſired to be reſolved by many of your Side, but never could.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That they are to uſe their beſt endeavours to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Scripture in the true ſenſe and to live according to it. This if they perform (as I hope many on all Sides do) truly and ſincerely, it is impoſſible but that they ſhould believe aright in all things neceſſary to Salvation: that is, in all thoſe things which appertain to the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant between God and man in Chriſt, for ſo much, is not only plainly but frequently contained in Scripture. And believing aright touching the Covenant, if they for their parts perform the condition required of them, which is ſincere obedience, why ſhould they not expect that God will perform his promiſe and give them Salvation?
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:57896:26"/>For, as for other things which lie without the Covenant, and are therefore leſs neceſſary, if by reaſon of the ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conflict which is oftentimes between Scripture and Reaſon, and Authority on the one ſide, and Scripture, Reaſon, and Authority on the other; if by reaſon of the variety of tempers, Abilities, Educations, and unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able prejudices, whereby mens underſtandings are vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly formed and faſhioned, they do embrace ſeveral Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, whereof ſome muſt be erroneous; to ſay that God will Damn them for ſuch Errors, who are lovers of him, and lovers of truth, is to rob man of his comfort, and God of his goodneſs; it is to make Man deſperate and God a Tyrant. <hi>But they deny Truths teſtified by God, and therefore ſhall be Damned.</hi> Yes, if they knew them to be thus teſtified by him, and yet would deny them, that were to give God the lie, and queſtionleſs damnable. But if you ſhould deny a truth which God had teſtified but only to a Man in the <hi>Indies,</hi> (as I ſaid before) and this teſtification you had never heard of, or at leaſt had no ſufficient reaſon to believe that God had ſo teſtified, would not you think it a hard caſe to be Damned for ſuch a denial? Yet conſider I pray a little more attentive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the difference between them, and you will preſently acknowledge, the queſtion between them is not at any time, or in any thing, Whether God ſays true or no? or whether he ſays this or no? But ſuppoſing he ſays this, and ſays true, whether he means this or no? As for example, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Lutherans, Calviniſts,</hi> and <hi>Zwinglians,</hi> it is agreed that Chriſt ſpake theſe Words, <hi>This is my Body;</hi> and that whatſoever he meant in ſaying ſo is true: But what he meant and how he is to be underſtood, that's the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion. So that though ſome of them deny a truth by God intended, yet you can with no reaſon or juſtice ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe them of denying the truth of Gods Teſtimony, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs you can plainly ſhew that God hath declared, and that plainly and clearly, what was his meaning in theſe Words. I ſay <hi>plainly and clearly.</hi> For he that ſpeaks ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurely and ambiguouſly, and no where declares him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf plainly, ſure he hath no reaſon to be much offended if he be miſtaken. When therefore you can ſhew, that
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:57896:26"/>in this and all other their Controverſies, God hath inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed his Teſtimony on one ſide or other; ſo that either they do ſee it, and will not; or were it not for their own voluntary and avoidable fault, might and ſhould ſee it and do not; let all ſuch Errors be as damnable as you pleaſe to make them. In the mean while, if they ſuffer themſelves neither to be betraid into their Errors, nor kept in them by any ſin of their will; if they do their beſt endeavour to free themſelves from all Errors, and yet fail of it through humane frailty; ſo well am I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded of the goodneſs of God, that if in me alone, ſhould meet a confluence of all ſuch Errors of all the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in the World, that were thus qualified, I ſhould not be ſo much afraid of them all, as I ſhould be to ask pardon for them. For, whereas that which you affright us with of calling Gods Veracity in Queſtion, is but a Panick fear, a fault that no man thus qualified, is, or can be guilty of; to ask pardon of ſimple and purely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voluntary errors is tacitely to imply that God is angry with us for them, and that to impute to him the ſtrange Tyranny of <hi>requiring Brick, when he gives no Straw; of expecting to gather, where he ſtrewed not; to reap where he ſowed not:</hi> of being offended with us for not doing what he knows we cannot do. This I ſay upon a ſuppoſition, that they do their beſt endeavours to know Gods will and do it; which he that denys to be poſſible, knows not what he ſays; for he ſays in effect, that Men cannot do, what they can do; for to do what a Man can do, is to do his beſt endeavour. But becauſe this ſuppoſition, though certainly poſſible, is very rare, and admirable, I ſay ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that I am verily perſuaded, that God will not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute Errors to them, as ſins, who uſe ſuch a meaſure of induſtry, in finding truth, as humane <hi>prudence</hi> and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary <hi>diſcretion</hi> (their abilities and opportunities, their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractions and hindrances, and all other things conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) ſhall adviſe them unto, in a matter of ſuch conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. But if herein alſo we fail, then our Errors be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to be malignant, and juſtly imputable, as offences againſt God, and that love of his truth which he requires
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:57896:27"/>in us. You will ſay then, that for thoſe Erring <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants,</hi> which are in this caſe, which evidently are far the greater part, they ſin damnably in Erring, and therefore there is little hope of their Salvation. To which I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that the conſequence of this Reaſon, is ſomewhat ſtrong againſt a <hi>Proteſtant;</hi> but much weakned by coming out of the Mouth of a <hi>Papiſt.</hi> For all Sins with you are not damnable. But yet out of courteſie to you, we will remove this rubb out of your way; and for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſuppoſe them <hi>mortal Sins;</hi> and is there then no hope of Salvation, for him that commits them? Not, you will ſay, if he Die in them without repentance; and ſuch <hi>Proteſtants</hi> you ſpeak of, <hi>who without Repentance Die in their Errors.</hi> Yea but what if they Die in their Errors with Repentance? than I hope you will have Charity enough to think they may be ſaved. <hi>Charity Miſt.</hi> takes it indeed for granted,
<note place="margin">In the place a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove quoted.</note> that this ſuppoſition is diſtructive of it ſelf; and that it is impoſſible, and incongruous, that a Man ſhould repent of thoſe Errors wherein he Dies; or Die in thoſe whereof he repents. But it was wiſely done of Him to take it for granted; for moſt certainly He could not have ſpoken one word of ſenſe for the confirmation of it. For ſeeing <hi>Proteſtants</hi> believe, as well as you, Gods infinite and moſt admirable perfections in himſelf, more than moſt worthy of all poſſible love: ſeeing they believe, as well as you, his infinite goodneſs to them, in Creating them of nothing; in Creating them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his own Image; in Creating all things for their uſe and benefit; in ſtreaming down his Favours on them every moment of their Lives; in deſigning them, if they ſerve him, to infinite and Eternal Happineſs; in Redeeming them, not with corruptible things, but the Pretious Blood of his beloved Son: ſeeing they believe, as well as you, His infinite goodneſs, and Patience to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, in expecting their Converſion; in Wooing, Alluring, Leading, and by all means, which his Wiſdom can Suggeſt unto him, and Mans nature is capable of, drawing them to Repentance and Salvation: Seeing they believe theſe things as well as you, and for ought you
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:57896:27"/>know, conſider them as much as you, (and if they do not, it is not their Religion, but they that are to blame,) what can hinder, but that the conſideration of Gods moſt infinite goodneſs to them, and their own almoſt infinite wickedneſs againſt him, Gods Spirit cooperating with them, may raiſe them to a true and ſincere and a cordial love of God? And ſeeing ſorrow for having injured or offended the Perſon beloved, or when we fear we may have offended him, is the moſt natural effect of true love; what can hinder, but that love which hath oftimes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained them, to lay down their lives for God (which our Saviour aſſures us is the nobleſt Sacrifice we can of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,) may produce in them an univerſal ſorrow for all their ſins, both which they know they have committed, and which they fear they may have? In which number, their being negligent, or not diſpaſſionate, or not unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicate enough in ſeeking the truth, and the effect there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, their Errors, if they be ſins, cannot but be compriz'd. In a word, what ſhould hinder, but that, that Prayer— <hi>Delicta ſua quis intelligit? who can underſtand his faults? Lord cleanſe thou me from my ſecret ſins,</hi> may be heard and accepted by God, as well from a <hi>Proteſtant</hi> that Dies in ſome Errors, as from a <hi>Papiſt</hi> that Dies in ſome other ſins of Ignorance, which perhaps he might more eaſily have diſcovered to be ſins, than a <hi>Proteſtant</hi> could his Errors to be Errors? As well from a <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> that held ſome Error, which (as he conceived) Gods Word and his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, (which is alſo in ſome ſort Gods Word) led him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; as from a <hi>Dominican,</hi> who perhaps took up his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion upon truſt, not becauſe he had reaſon to believe it true, but becauſe it was the opinion of his <hi>Order;</hi> for the ſame man if he had light upon another Order, would in all probability, have been of the other Opinion. For what elſe is the cauſe, that generally <hi>all the Dominicans are of one Opinion, and all the Jeſuits of the other?</hi> I ſay, from a <hi>Dominican</hi> who took up his Opinion upon truſt; and that ſuch an Opinion (if we believe the writers of your Order) as if it be granted true, it were not a point matter, what Opinions any man held, or what actions
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:57896:28"/>any man did, for the beſt would be as bad as the worſt, and the worſt as good as the beſt. And yet ſuch is the partiality of your Hypocriſie, that of diſagreeing <hi>Papiſts,</hi> neither ſhall deny the truth teſtified by God, but both may hope for Salvation: but of diſagreeing <hi>Proteſtants</hi> (though they differ in the ſame thing,) one ſide muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Gods Teſtimony and be incapable of Salvation. That a <hi>Dominican</hi> through culpable negligence, living and dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his Error, may repent of it, though he knows it not; or be ſaved though he do not: But if a <hi>Proteſtant</hi> do the very ſame thing, in the very ſame point, and Die in his Error, his caſe is deſperate. The Sum of all that hath been ſaid to this Demand is this. 1. That no Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring <hi>Proteſtant</hi> denys any truth teſtified by God, under this formality, <hi>as teſtified by him;</hi> nor which they know or believe to be teſtified by him. And therefore it is a horrible Calumny in you to ſay, <hi>They call Gods Veracity in queſtion.</hi> For Gods undoubted and unqueſtioned Veraci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, is to them the ground, why they hold all they do hold: neither do they hold any Opinion ſo ſtifly, but they will forgoe it rather than this one, <hi>That all which God ſays is true.</hi> 2. God hath not ſo clearly and plainly declared himſelf in moſt of theſe things which are in controverſie between <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> but that an honeſt man, whoſe heart is right to God, and one that is a true lover of God, and of his truth, may by reaſon of the conflict of contrary Reaſons on both ſides, very eaſily, and therefore excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſably miſtake, and embrace Error for Truth, and reject Truth for Error. 3. If any <hi>Proteſtant</hi> or <hi>Papiſt</hi> be betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into, or kept in any Error, by any ſin of his will (as it is to be feared many Millions are) ſuch Error is, as the cauſe of it, ſinful and damnable: yet not excluſive of all hope of Salvation, but pardonable if diſcovered, upon a particular explicite repentance; if not diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, upon a general and implicite repentance for all Sins known and unknown: in which number all ſinful Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors muſt of neceſſity be contained.</p>

<pb n="48" facs="tcp:57896:29"/>as much depends, as upon a particular Catalogue of our <hi>Fundamentals.</hi> As for example. Whether or no a man do not Err in ſome point defined and ſufficiently propoſed: and whether or no thoſe that differ among you, differ in <hi>Fundamentals;</hi> which if they do <hi>One Heaven</hi> (by your own Rule) <hi>cannot receive them All.</hi> Perhaps you will here com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, that this is not to ſatisfie your demand, but to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void it, and to put you off as the <hi>Areopagites</hi> did hard Cauſes <hi>ad diem longiſſimum,</hi> and bid you come again a Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Years hence: To deal truly, I did ſo intend it ſhould be. Neither can you ſay, my dealing with you is inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, ſeeing I require nothing of you, but that, what you require of others, you ſhould ſhew it poſſible to be done, and juſt and neceſſary to be required. For, for my part, I have great reaſon to ſuſpect, it is neither the one nor the other. For whereas the Verities which are deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in Scripture, may be very fitly divided into <hi>ſuch as were written becauſe they were neceſſary to be believed,</hi> Of which rank are thoſe only which conſtitute and make up the Covenant between God and Man in Chriſt: and then <hi>ſuch as are neceſſary to be believed not in themſelves but only by accident, becauſe they were written.</hi> Of which rank are many matters of Hiſtory, of Prophecy, of Myſtery, of Policy, of Oeconomy, and ſuch like, which are evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently not <hi>intrinſecal</hi> to the Covenant. Now to ſever ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly and punctally theſe Verities one from the other: what is <hi>neceſsary in it ſelf</hi> and antecedently to the writing, from what is but only profitable in it ſelf, and <hi>neceſſary only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe written,</hi> is a buſineſs of extream great difficulty, and extream little neceſſity. For firſt he that will go about to diſtinguiſh eſpecially in the ſtory of our Saviour, what was written becauſe it was <hi>profitable,</hi> from what was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten becauſe <hi>neceſſary,</hi> ſhall find an intricate peice of buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of it, and almoſt impoſſible that he ſhould be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain he hath done it, when he hath done it. And then it is apparently unneceſſary to go about it, ſeeing he that believes all, certainly believes all that is neceſſary. And he that doth not believe all (I mean all the undoubted parts of the undoubted Books of Scripture) can hardly
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:57896:29"/>believe any, neither have we reaſon to believe he doth ſo. So that, that <hi>Proteſtants</hi> give you not a Catalogue of <hi>Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals,</hi> it is not from Tergiverſation (as you ſuſpect, who for want of Charity to them always ſuſpect the worſt,) but from Wiſdom and Neceſſity. For they may very eaſily Err in doing it; becauſe though all which is neceſſary be plain in Scripture, yet all which is plain is not therefore written becauſe it was neceſſary. For what greater neceſſity was there that I ſhould know S. <hi>Paul left his Cloak at</hi> Troas, than thoſe <hi>Worlds of Miracles,</hi> which our Saviour did, which were never written. And when they had done it, it had been to no purpoſe; There being as matters now ſtand, as great neceſſity, of believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe truths of Scripture, which are not Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, as thoſe that are. You ſee then what reaſon we have to decline this hard labour, which you a rigid Task-maſter have here put upon us. Yet inſtead of giving you a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue of Fundamentals, with which I dare ſay you are reſolved before it come, never to be ſatisfied, I will ſay that to you, which if you pleaſe may do you as much ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; and this it is. That it is ſufficient for any Mans Salvation that he believe the Scripture: That he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to believe it in the true ſenſe of it, as far as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns his Duty: And that he conform his Life unto it either by Obedience or Repentance. He that does ſo (and all <hi>Proteſtants</hi> according to the <hi>Doctamen</hi> of their Religion ſhould do ſo,) may be ſecure that he cannot Err Fundamentally.

                        <hi>CHIL.</hi> I wiſh with all my Heart that you had expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed your ſelf in this matter more fully and plainly. Yet that which you ſay, doth plainly enough afford us theſe Corolla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. 1. That whatſoever <hi>Proteſtant</hi> wanteth Capacity, or hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, wanteth ſufficient means of inſtruction to convince his Conſcience of the falſhood of his own, and the truth of the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion, by the confeſſion of his moſt rigid Adverſaries, may be ſaved, notwithſtanding any Error in his Religion. 2. That nothing hinders but that a <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Dying a <hi>Proteſtant</hi> may Die with contrition for all his Sins. 3. That if he Die with Contrition, he may and ſhall be ſaved.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. All theſe acknowledgments we have from you, while you are, as you ſay, ſtating, but, as I conceive grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the very point in queſtion. So that according to your Doctrine, the heavy ſentence ſhall remain upon <hi>ſuch only, as either were, or but for their own fault, might have been ſufficiently convinced of the truth of your Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the falſhood of their own, and yet Die in it without contrition.</hi> Which Doctrine if you would ſtand to, and not pull down, and pull back with one hand, what you give and build with the other, this controverſie were ended; and I ſhould willingly acknowledge, that which follows in your fourth paragraph; <hi>That you allow</hi> Proteſtants <hi>as much Charity as</hi> D. Potter <hi>allows you.</hi> But then I muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat you to alter the <hi>argument of this Chapter,</hi> and not to go about to give us reaſons, <hi>why amongſt Men of different Religions, one ſide only can be ſaved abſolutely,</hi> which your Reaſons drive at: But you muſt temper the crudeneſs of your Aſſertion by ſaying, <hi>One Side only can be ſaved, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs want of Conviction, or elſe Repentance excuſe the other.</hi> Beſides you muſt not only abſtain from damning any <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant</hi> in particular, but from affirming in general, that Proteſtants <hi>Dying in their Religion cannot be ſaved;</hi> for you muſt always remember to add this caution, unleſs <hi>they were excuſably ignorant of the falſhood of it, or Died with contrition.</hi> And then conſidering that you cannot know, whether or no, all things conſidered, they were convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced ſufficiently of the truth of your Religion and the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:57896:31"/>falſhood of their own, you are obliged by Charity to judge the beſt, and hope they are not. Conſidering again, that notwithſtanding their Errors, they may Die with contrition, and that it is no way improbable that they do ſo, and the contrary you cannot be certain of, You are bound in Charity to judge and hope they do ſo. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering thirdly and laſtly, that if they Die not with <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition,</hi> yet it is very probable they may Die with <hi>Attriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and that this pretence of yours, that <hi>Contrition will ſerve without actual Confeſſion, but Attrition will not,</hi> is but a Nicety or Phanſie, or rather to give it the true name, a Device of your own, to ſerve ends and purpoſes; (God having no where declared himſelf, but that whereſoever he will accept of that Repentance, which you are pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to call <hi>Contrition,</hi> he will accept of that which you call <hi>Attrition;</hi> For though he like beſt the bright Flam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Holocauſt of Love, yet he rejects not, he quenches not the ſmoaking Flax of that Repentance (if it be true and effectual) which proceeds from hope and fear:) Theſe things I ſay, conſidered, (unleſs you will have the Charity of your Doctrine riſe up in judgment againſt your uncharitable Practice) you muſt not only not be peremptory, in damning <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> but you muſt hope well of their Salvation: and out of this hope, you muſt do for them as well as others, thoſe, as you conceive, Charitable offices, of Praying, giving Alms and offering Sacrifice, which uſually you do, for thoſe of whoſe Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation you are well and Charitably perſuaded; (for I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve you will never conceive ſo well of Proteſtants, as to aſſure your ſelves they go directly to Heaven.) Theſe things when you do I ſhall believe you think as Charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly as you ſpeak. But until then, as he ſaid in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, <hi>Quid verba audiam cum facta videam?</hi> ſo may I ſay to you, <hi>Quid verba audiam cum facta non videam?</hi> To what purpoſe ſhould you give us Charitable Words, which preſently you retract again, by denying us your Charitable Actions. And as theſe things you muſt do, if you will ſtand to and make good this pretended Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, ſo muſt I tell you again and again, that one thing
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:57896:32"/>you muſt not doe; I mean you muſt not affright poor People out of their Religion, with telling them, that <hi>by the Confeſſion of both ſides, your way is ſafe, but in your judgment, ours undoubtedly damnable.</hi> Seeing neither you deny Salvation to <hi>Proteſtants Dying with repentance,</hi> nor we promiſe it to you, <hi>if ye Die without it.</hi> For to deal plainly with you, I know no <hi>Proteſtant</hi> that hath any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hope of your Salvation, but upon theſe grounds, that <hi>unaffected ignorance</hi> may excuſe you, or <hi>true repentance</hi> obtain pardon for you; neither do the heavy cenſures which <hi>Proteſtants</hi> (you ſay) paſs upon your Errors, any way hinder but they may hope as well of you, upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, as I do. For the <hi>fierce Doctrine,</hi> which, God knows who, teaches, that <hi>Chriſt for many Ages before</hi> Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>had no viſible Church upon Earth;</hi> will be mild enough, if you conceive them to mean (as perhaps they do) by <hi>no viſible Church, none pure and free from corruptions,</hi> which in your judgment is all one with no Church. But the truth is the <hi>corruption</hi> of the Church, and the <hi>deſtruction</hi> of it, is not all one. For if a particular man or Church may (as you confeſs they may) hold ſome particular Errors, and yet be a member of the Church Univerſal: why may not the Church hold ſome Univerſal Error, and yet be ſtill the Church? eſpecially, ſeeing you ſay, it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but <hi>oppoſing the Doctrine of the Church, that makes an Error damnable,</hi> and it is impoſſible that the Church ſhould oppoſe the Church, I mean that the preſent Church ſhould oppoſe it ſelf. And then for the <hi>Engliſh Proteſtants,</hi> though they cenſure your Errors deeply, yet, by your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, with their deepeſt cenſures it may well conſiſt that <hi>invincible ignorance</hi> may excuſe you from damnation for them. For you your ſelf confeſs <hi>that ignorance may excuſe Errors, even in Fundamental Articles of Faith: ſo that a man ſo erring ſhall not offend at all in ſuch his ignorance or Error;</hi> they are your own words. p. 19. And again with their heavieſt cenſures it may well conſiſt, that your Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors though in themſelves damanble, yet may prove <hi>not damning</hi> to you, if you Die with true repentance, for all your ſins known and unknown.</p>
                     <pb n="55" facs="tcp:57896:32"/>
                     <p n="5">5. Thus much Charity therefore, if you ſtand to what you have ſaid, is interchangeably granted by each Side to the other, that Neither Religion is ſo fatally <hi>deſtructive, but that by ignorance or repentance Salvation may be had on both Sides:</hi> though with a difference that keeps <hi>Papiſts</hi> ſtill on the more uncharitable Side. For whereas we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a lower degree of repentance (that which they call <hi>Attrition</hi>) if it be true, and effectual, and convert the Heart of the Penitent, will ſerve in them: They pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend (even this <hi>Author</hi> which is moſt charitable towards us,) that <hi>without Contrition</hi> there is no hope for us: But though <hi>Proteſtants</hi> may not obtain this purchaſe at ſo eaſie a rate as <hi>Papiſts,</hi> yet (even <hi>Papiſts</hi> being Judges) they may obtain it; and though there is no entrance for them but at the only door of <hi>Contrition,</hi> yet they may enter, Heaven is not inacceſſible to them. Their Errors are no ſuch impenetrable Iſtmus's between them and Salvation, but that <hi>Contrition</hi> may make a way through them. All their Schiſm and Hereſie is no ſuch fatal Poyſon, but that if a man joyn with it the Antidote of a general re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, he may Die in it, and live for ever. Thus much then being acknowledged, I appeal to any indifferent reader, whether <hi>C. M.</hi> be not by his <hi>Hyperaſpiſt</hi> forſaken in the plain Field, and the point in queſtion granted to D. <hi>Potter,</hi> viz. <hi>That Proteſtancy even without a particular repentance, is not deſtructive of Salvation;</hi> ſo that all the Controverſie remaining now, is, not ſimply whether <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtancy unrepented deſtroys Salvation?</hi> as it was at firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, but <hi>Whether Proteſtancy in it ſelf</hi> (that is <hi>abſtracting from ignorance and contrition</hi>) <hi>deſtroys Salvation?</hi> So that as a fooliſh Fellow who gave a Knight the Lie, deſiring withal leave of him to ſet his Knighthood aſide, was anſwered by him, that he would not ſuffer any thing to be ſet aſide that belonged unto him: So might we juſtly take it amiſs, that conceiving as you do Ignorance and Repentance ſuch neceſſary things for us, you are not more willing to conſider us with them, than without them. For my part ſuch is my Charity to you, that conſidering what great neceſſity <hi>You</hi> have, as much as any
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:57896:33"/>
                        <hi>Chriſtian Society in the World,</hi> that theſe Sanctuaries of <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance</hi> and <hi>Repentance</hi> ſhould always ſtand open, I can very hardly perſuade my ſelf ſo much as in my moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret conſideration to deveſt you of theſe ſo needful qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications: But whenſoever your Errors, ſuperſtitions and impieties come into my mind, (and beſides the general bonds of humanity and Chriſtianity, my own particular Obligations to many of you, ſuch and ſo great, that you cannot periſh without a part of my ſelf,) my only comfort is amidſt theſe Agonies, that the Doctrine and Practice too of Repentance, is yet remaining in your Church: And that though you put on a Face of confidence of your Innocence in point of Doctrine, yet you will be glad to ſtand in the Eye of Mercy as well as your fellows, and not be ſo ſtout, as to refuſe either Gods pardon or the Kings.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. But for the preſent, Proteſtancy is called to the Barr, and though not ſentenced by you to Death without Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, yet arraigned of ſo much natural malignity (if not corrected by <hi>Ignorance</hi> or <hi>Contrition</hi>) as to be <hi>in it ſelf de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive of Salvation.</hi> Which controverſie I am content to diſpute with you; only remembring you, that the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of this limitation <hi>[in it ſelf]</hi> hath made this a new Queſtion, and that this is not the concluſion for which you were charged with <hi>want of Charity.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="7">7. Ad 7. and 8. §.] C. M. <hi>Now this is our gradatio nof reaſons. Almighty God having ordained mankind to a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural end of Eternal Felicity, hath in his providence ſetled competent Means,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>CHIL.</hi> In your gradation I ſhall riſe ſo far with you as to grant, <hi>that Chriſt founded a viſible Church, ſtored with all helps neceſſary to Salvation, particularly with ſufficient means to beget and conſerve Faith, to maintain Unity, and compoſe Schiſms, to diſcover and condemn Hereſies, and to determine all controverſies in Religion,</hi> which were neceſſary to be determined. For all theſe purpoſes, he gave at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning (as we may ſee in the Ep. to the <hi>Epheſians</hi>) <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, Prophets, Evangeliſts, Paſtors, and Doctors:</hi> who by word of mouth taught their contemporaries, and by wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:57896:33"/>(wrote indeed by ſome, but approved by all of them) taught their Chriſtian poſterity to the Worlds End, how all theſe ends, and that which is the End of all theſe ends, Salvation, is to be atchieved. And theſe means the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God hath ſtill preſerved, and ſo preſerved, that they are ſufficient for all theſe intents. I ſay <hi>ſufficient,</hi> though, through the Malice of Men, not always <hi>effectual,</hi> for that the ſame means may be ſufficient for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing an end, and not effectual, you muſt not deny, who hold that <hi>God gives all men ſufficient means of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and yet that all are not ſaved.</hi> I ſaid alſo, ſufficient to determine all controverſies, which <hi>were neceſſary to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined.</hi> For if ſome controverſies may for many Ages be undetermined, and yet in the mean while men be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; why ſhould, or how can the Churches being fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with effectual means to determine <hi>all</hi> Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies in Religion be neceſſary to Salvation, the end it ſelf, to which theſe means are ordained being as experience ſhews not neceſſary? Plain ſenſe will teach every man, that the neceſſity of the means muſt always be meaſured by, and can never exceed the neceſſity of the end. As if eating be neceſſary, only that I may live, then certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if I have no neceſſity to live, I have no neceſſity to eat. If I have no need to be at <hi>London,</hi> I have no need of a Horſe to carry me thither. If I have no need to Fly, I have no need of Wings. Anſwer me then I pray directly, and Categorically, Is it neceſſary that all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies in Religion ſhould be determined, or is it not? If it be, why is the queſtion of <hi>Predetermination,</hi> of the <hi>immaculate conception,</hi> of the <hi>Popes indirect power in tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poralties,</hi> ſo long undetermined? if not, what is it but Hypocriſie to pretend ſuch great neceſſity of ſuch effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual means, for the archieving that end, which is it ſelf not neceſſary. Chriſtians therefore have and ſhall have <hi>means ſufficient</hi> (though not always effectual) <hi>to determine</hi> not all <hi>controverſies</hi> but <hi>all neceſſary to be determined.</hi> I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed on farther with you, and grant that this means to decide controverſies in Faith and Religion, muſt be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with an Univerſal Infallibility in whatſoever it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:57896:34"/>for a Divine truth. For if it may be falſe in any one thing of this nature, in any thing which God requires men to believe, we can yield unto it but a wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering and fearful aſſent in any thing. Theſe grounds therefore I grant very readily, and give you free leave to make your beſt advantage of them. And yet, to deal truly, I do not perceive how from the denial of any of them it would follow that Faith is Opinion: or from the granting them, that it is not ſo. But for my part, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever clamour you have raiſed againſt me, I think no otherwiſe of the Nature of Faith, I mean <hi>Hiſtorical Faith,</hi> than generally both <hi>Proteſtants</hi> and <hi>Papiſts</hi> do; for I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it <hi>an aſſent to Divine Revelations upon the Authority of the revealer.</hi> Which though in many things it differ from Opinion, (as commonly the Word <hi>Opinion</hi> is underſtood) yet in ſome things, I doubt not but you will confeſs, that it agrees with it. As firſt, that as Opinion is an Aſſent, ſo is Faith alſo. Secondly, that as Opinion, ſo Faith is always built upon leſs evidence than that of Sence or Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Which aſſertion you not only grant but mainly contend for in your <hi>ſixth Ch.</hi> Thirdly and laſtly, that as Opinion, ſo Faith admits degrees; and that as there may be a ſtrong and weak Opinion, ſo there may be a ſtrong and weak Faith. Theſe things if you will grant (as ſure if you be in your right mind you will not deny any of them) I am well contented that this ill-ſounding Word, <hi>Opinion,</hi> ſhould be diſcarded, and that among the Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual habits you ſhould ſeek out ſome other <hi>Genus</hi> for <hi>Faith.</hi> For I will never contend with any man about Words, who grants my meaning.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. <hi>But though the Eſſence of Faith exclude not all weakneſs and imperfection, yet may it be enquired, whether any certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Faith, under the higheſt degree may be ſufficient to pleaſe God and attain Salvation.</hi> Whereunto I anſwer, that though men are unreaſonable, God requires not any thing but Reaſon. They will not be pleaſed without a down weight, but God is contented if the Scale be turned. They pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, that Heavenly things cannot be ſeen to any pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, but by the mid-day-light: But God will be ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:57896:34"/>if we receive any degree of light which makes us leave the <hi>Works of Darkneſs and walk as Children of the Light.</hi> They exact a certainty of Faith above that of Sence or Science, God deſires only that we believe the concluſion, as much as the premiſes deſerve, that the ſtrength of our Faith be equal or proportionable to the credibility of the Motives to it. Now though I have and ought to have an abſolute certainty of this Theſis, <hi>All which God reveals for truth is true,</hi> being a propoſition that may be demonſtrated, or rather ſo evident to any one that underſtands it, that it needs it not; Yet of this Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis, <hi>That all the Articles of our Faith were revealed by God,</hi> we cannot ordinarily have any rational and acquired cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, more than moral, founded upon theſe conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: Firſt that the goodneſs of the precepts of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and the greatneſs of the promiſes of it, ſhews it, of all other Religions, moſt likely to come from the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of goodneſs. And then that a conſtant, famous and very general Tradition, ſo credible, that no Wiſe Man doubts of any other, which hath but the Fortieth part of the credibility of this, ſuch and ſo credible a Tradition, tells us, that God himſelf hath ſet his Hand and Seal to the Truth of this Doctrine, by doing great, and glorious, and frequent miracles in confirmation of it. Now our Faith is an aſſent to this concluſion, that <hi>the Doctrine of Chriſtianity is true,</hi> which being deduced from the former <hi>Theſis,</hi> which is Metapyhſically certain, and from the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> whereof we can have but a Moral certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, we cannot poſſibly by natural means be more certain of it than of the weaker of the premiſes; as a River will not riſe higher than the Fountain from which it flows. For the concluſion always follows the worſer part, if there be any worſe: and muſt be Negative, Particular, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent, or but Morally certain, if any of the Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, from whence it is derived be ſo: Neither can we be certain of it in the higheſt degree, unleſs we be thus cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of all the principles whereon it is grounded. As a man cannot go or ſtand ſtrongly, if either of his Legs be weak. Or as a building cannot be ſtable, if any one
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:57896:35"/>of the neceſſary Pillars thereof be infirm and inſtable. Or as, If a meaſſage be brought me, from a man of abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute credit with me, but by a meſſenger that is not ſo, my confidence of the Truth of the Relation, cannot but be rebated and leſſened, by my diffidence in the Relator.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. Yet all this I ſay not as if I doubted, that the Spirit of God, being implored by devout and humble Prayer and ſincere obedience, may, and will by degrees, advance his ſervants higher, and give them a certainty of adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, beyond their certainty of evidence. But what God gives as a reward to believers, is one thing: and what he requires of all men, as their duty, is another: and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>he will accept of out of grace and favour, is yet another. To thoſe that believe and live according to their Faith, he gives by degrees the <hi>ſpirit of obſignation and confirmation,</hi> which makes them know (though how they know not) what they did but believe: And to be as fully and reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely aſſured of the Goſpel of Chriſt, as thoſe which heard it from Chriſt himſelf with their Ears, which ſaw it with their Eyes, which looked upon it, and whoſe hands hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Word of Life. He requires of all, that their Faith ſhould be (as I have ſaid) proportionable to the motives and Reaſons enforcing to it; he will accept of the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and loweſt degree of Faith, if it be living and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual unto true obedience. For he it is that <hi>will not quench the ſmoaking Flax, nor break the bruiſed Reed.</hi> He did not reject the Prayer of that diſtreſſed man that cried unto him, <hi>Lord I believe, Lord help my unbelief.</hi> He commands us to <hi>receive them that are weak in Faith,</hi> and thereby de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares that he receives them. And as nothing avails with him, but Faith <hi>wich worketh by love:</hi> So any Faith, if it be but as a <hi>grain of Muſtard ſeed,</hi> if it <hi>work by love,</hi> ſhall certainly avail with him and be accepted of him. Some experience makes me fear, that the Faith of conſidering and diſcourſing men, is like to be crackt with too much ſtraining: And that being poſſeſſed with this <hi>falſe</hi> Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, that it is in vain to believe the Goſpel of Chriſt, with ſuch a kind or degree of aſſent, as they yield to other matters of Tradition: And finding that their Faith of it,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:57896:35"/>is to them undiſcernable, from the belief they give to the truth of other Stories; are in danger either not to believe at all, thinking not at all as good as to no purpoſe, or elſe, though indeed they do believe it, yet to think they do not, and to caſt themſelves into wretched agonies and perplexities, as fearing they have not that, without which it is impoſſible to pleaſe God and obtain Eternal happineſs. Conſideration of this advantage, which the Devil proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly may make of this Phanſie, made me willing to inſiſt ſomewhat largely upon the Refutation of it.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. I return now thither from whence I have digreſſed, and aſſure you, concerning the grounds afore-laid, which were, that there is a <hi>Rule of Faith, whereby controverſies may be decided, which are neceſſary to be decided,</hi> and that <hi>this rule is Univerſally infallible,</hi> That notwithſtanding any Opinion I hold, touching Faith, or any thing elſe, I may, and do believe them, as firmly as you pretend to do. And therefore you may build on, in Gods name, for by Gods help, I ſhall always embrace, whatſoever ſtructure is naturally and rationally laid upon them, whatſoever concluſion may, to my underſtanding, be evidently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced from them. You ſay, out of them it undeniably follows, <hi>That of two diſagreeing in matter of Faith, the one cannot be ſaved, but by Repentance or Ignorance.</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer by diſtinction of thoſe terms, <hi>two diſſenting in a matter of Faith.</hi> For it may be either in a thing which is indeed a <hi>matter of Faith,</hi> in the ſtricteſt ſenſe, that is, ſomething, the Belief whereof God requires under pain of damnation: And ſo the concluſion is true, though the Conſequence of it from your former premiſſes either is none at all, or ſo obſcure, that I can hardly diſcern it. Or it may be as it oftens falls out concerning a thing which being indeed <hi>no matter of Faith, is yet overvalued</hi> by the Parties at variance, and eſteemed to be ſo. And in this ſenſe it is neither conſequent nor true. The untruth of it I have already declared in my examination of your Preface. The inconſequence of it is of it ſelf evident; for who ever heard of a wilder Collection than this —

                     <p>He that can find any connection between theſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, I believe will be able to find good coherence between the Deaf Plantiff's Accuſation, in the <hi>Greek</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pigram, and the Deaf Defendants Anſwer, and the Deaf Judges Sentence: And to contrive them all into a formal Categorical Syllogiſm.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. Indeed if the matter in agitation were plainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided, by this infallible means of deciding Controverſies, and the Parties in variance knew it to be ſo, and yet would ſtand out in their diſſention; this were in one of them, direct oppoſition to the Teſtimony of God, and undoubtedly a damnable ſin. But if you take the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to ſuppoſe what you pleaſe, you may very eaſily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude what you liſt. For who is ſo fooliſh as to grant you theſe unreaſonable Poſtulates, that every emergent Controverſie of Faith, is plainly decided by the means of diciſion which God hath appointed, and that of the Parties litigant, one is always ſuch a convicted Recuſant as you pretend! Certainly, if you ſay ſo, having no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter warrant than you have, or can have for it, this is more proper and formal uncharitableneſs, than ever was charged upon you. Methinks, with much more Reaſon, and much more Charity, you might ſuppoſe, that many of theſe Controverſies which are now diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted among Chriſtians (all which profeſs themſelves lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Chriſt, and truly deſirous to know his Will and do it) are either <hi>not decidable</hi> by that means which God hath provided, and ſo not neceſſary to be decided: Or if they be, yet <hi>not ſo plainly and evidently,</hi> as to oblige all men to hold one way: or Laſtly, if decidable, and evidently decided, yet you may hope that the erring part, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of ſome Vail before his Eyes, <hi>ſome excuſable ignorance or unavoidable prejudice,</hi> does not ſee the Queſtion to be decided againſt him, and ſo oppoſes not that which He
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:57896:36"/>doth know to be the word of God, but only that which You know to be ſo, and which he might know, were he void of prejudice. Which is a fault I confeſs, but a fault which is incident even to good and honeſt men ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry often: and not of ſuch a gigantick diſpoſition as you make it, to fly directly upon God Almighty, and to give him the Lie to his Face.</p>

                     <p>To all theſe Aſſertions I will content my ſelf for the preſent to oppoſe this one, That <hi>not one of them all is true.</hi> Only I may not omit to tell you, that if the firſt of them were as true as the <hi>Pope</hi> himſelf deſires it ſhould be, yet the Corollary which you deduce from it, would be utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inconſequent, That <hi>whoſoever denys any point propoſed by the Church, is injurious to Gods Divine Majeſty, as if he could deceive, or be deceived.</hi> For though your Church were indeed as <hi>Infallible a Propounder of Divine Truths</hi> as it pretends to be, yet if it appeared not to me to be ſo, I might very well believe God moſt true, and your Church moſt falſe. As though the Goſpel of S. <hi>Matthew</hi> be the Word of God, yet if I neither knew it to be ſo, nor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved it, I might believe in God, and yet think that Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel a Fable. Hereafter therefore I muſt entreat you to
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:57896:37"/>remember, that our being guilty of this impiety, depends not only upon your being, but upon our knowing that you are ſo. Neither muſt you argue thus, <hi>The Church of</hi> Rome <hi>is the Infallible Propounder of Divine Verities, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he that oppoſes Her calls Gods Truth in Queſtion:</hi> But thus rather; The <hi>Church of</hi> Rome <hi>is ſo, and</hi> Proteſtants <hi>know it to be ſo, therefore in oppoſing Her, they impute to God, that either he deceives them, or is deceived himſelf.</hi> For as I may deny ſomething which you upon your know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg have affirmed, and yet never diſparage your hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, if I never knew that you affirmed it: So I may be undoubtedly certain of Gods Omniſcience, and Veracity, and yet doubt of ſomething which he hath revealed, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided I do not know, nor believe that he hath revealed it. So, that though your Church be the appointed wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Gods Revelations; yet until you know, that we know ſhe is ſo, you cannot without foul Calumny impute to us, That <hi>we charge God blaſphemouſly with deceiving, or being deceived.</hi> You will ſay perhaps, That this is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly conſequent from our Doctrine, That the <hi>Church may Err,</hi> which is directed by God in all Her propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals. True, if we knew it to be directed by him, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe not; much leſs if we believe, and know the contrary. But then if it were conſequent from our Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, have you ſo little Charity as to ſay, that men are <hi>juſtly chargeable with all the conſequences of their Opinions.;</hi> Such conſequences, I mean, as they do not own but diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim, and if there were a neceſſity of doing either, would much rather forſake their Opinion than embrace theſe Conſequences? What Opinion is there that draws after it ſuch a Train of <hi>portentous Blaſphemies,</hi> as that of the <hi>Dominicans,</hi> by the judgment of the beſt Writers of your own <hi>Order?</hi> And will you ſay now that the <hi>Dominicans</hi> are juſtly chargeable with all theſe Blaſphemies? If not, ſeeing our caſe (take it at the worſt) is but the ſame, why ſhould not your judgment of us be the ſame? I appeal to all thoſe <hi>Proteſtants</hi> that have gone over to your Side; whether when they were moſt averſe from it, they did ever deny or doubt of <hi>Gods omniſcience or veracity;</hi>
                        <pb n="65" facs="tcp:57896:37"/>whether they did ever believe, or were taught, that <hi>God did deceive them, or was deceived himſelf.</hi> Nay, I provoke to you your ſelf, and deſire you to deal truly, and to tell Us whether you do in your Heart believe, that we do indeed not believe the Eternal Veracity of the Eternal Verity? And if you judge ſo ſtrangely of us, having no better ground for it, than you have or can have, we ſhall not need any farther proof of your uncharitableneſs towards us, this being the extremity of true uncharitableneſs. If not, then I hope having no other ground but this (which ſure is none at all) to pronounce us <hi>damnable Hereticks,</hi> you will ceaſe to do ſo; and hereafter (as, if your ground be true, you may do with more truth and Charity) Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect thus, <hi>They only Err damnably, who oppoſe what they know God hath teſtified,</hi> But Proteſtants <hi>ſure do not oppoſe what they know God hath teſtified, at leaſt we cannot with Charity ſay they do, Therefore they either do not Err damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, or with Charity we cannot ſay they do ſo.</hi>

Ad 17. §.] <hi>Proteſtants</hi> (you ſay) <hi>according to their own grounds muſt hold that of Perſons contrary in whatſoever point of belief one part only can be ſaved, therefore it is ſtrangely done of them to charge</hi> Papiſts <hi>with want of Charity for hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame.</hi> The conſequence I acknowledg, but won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der much what it ſhould be that lays upon <hi>Proteſtants</hi> any neceſſity to do ſo! You tell us it is their holding <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the ſole Rule of Faith:</hi> for this, you ſay, obligeth them to pronounce them damned, that oppoſe any leaſt point <hi>delivered in Scripture.</hi> This I grant, If they oppoſe it after ſufficient declaration, ſo that either they <hi>know it to be contained in Scripture,</hi> or have no juſt probable Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and which may move an honeſt man to doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or no it be there contained. For to oppoſe in the firſt Caſe in a man that believes the Scripture to be the Word of God, is to give God the Lie. To oppoſe in the ſecond, is to be obſtinate againſt Reaſon, and therefore a ſin though not ſo great as the former. But then this is nothing to the purpoſe of the neceſſity of damning all thoſe that are of contrary belief; and that for theſe Reaſons. Firſt, becauſe the contrary belief may be touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:57896:38"/>a point not at all mentioned in Scripture; and ſuch points, though indeed they be not <hi>matters of Faith,</hi> yet by men in variance are often over-valued and eſteemed to be ſo. So that, though it were damnable to oppoſe any point contained in Scripture; yet Perſons of a contrary belief (as <hi>Victor</hi> and <hi>Polycrates,</hi> S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> and <hi>Stephen</hi>) might both be ſaved, becauſe their contrary belief was not touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any point contained in Scripture. Secondly, becauſe the contrary belief may be about the ſenſe of ſome place of Scripture which is ambiguous, and with probability capable of diverſe Senſes; and in ſuch Caſes it is no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel, and ſure no Sin, if ſeveral men go ſeveral ways. Thirdly, becauſe the contrary belief may be concerning points wherein Scripture may with ſo great probability be alledged on both ſides, (which is a ſure note of a point <hi>not neceſſary</hi>) that men of honeſt and upright Hearts, true lovers of God and of truth, ſuch as deſire, above all things, to know Gods Will and to do it, may, without any fault at all, ſome go one way, and ſome another, and ſome (and thoſe as good men as either of the former) ſuſpend their judgments, and expect ſome <hi>Elias to ſolve doubts,</hi> and reconcile repugnances. Now in all ſuch Queſtions one ſide or other (which ſoever it is) holds that which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is oppoſite to the ſenſe of the Scripture, which God intended; for it is impoſſible that God ſhould intend Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions. But then this intended Senſe is not ſo fully declared, but that they which oppoſe it may verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that they indeed maintain it, and have great ſhew of reaſon to induce them to believe ſo; and therefore are not to be damned, as men oppoſing that which they either know to be a truth delivered in Scripture, or have no probable Reaſon to believe the contrary; but rather in Charity to be acquitted and abſolved, as men who endeavour to find the Truth, but fail of it through humane frailty.</p>
                     <p>This ground being laid, the Anſwer to your enſuing Interrogatories, which you conceive impoſſible, is very obvious and eaſie.</p>

                        <hi>CHIL.</hi> Ad §. 1.] He that would Uſurp an abſolute Lordſhip and Tyranny over any People, need not put himſelf to the trouble and difficulty of abrogating and diſanulling the Laws, made to maintain the Common Liberty; for he may fruſtrate their intent, and compaſs his own deſign as well, if he can get the Power and Authority to interpret them as he pleaſes, and add to them what he pleaſes, and to have his interpretations and additions ſtand for Laws; if he can rule his People by his Laws, and his Laws by his Lawyers. So the <hi>Church of</hi> Rome, to eſtabliſh Her Tyranny over mens Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, needed not either to aboliſh or corrupt the Holy Scriptures, the Pillars and Supporters of Chriſtian Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty (which in regard of the numerous multitude of Copies diſperſed through all places, Tranſlated into almoſt all Languages, guarded with all ſollicitous care and induſtry, had been an impoſſible attempt;) But the more expedite way, and therefore more likely to be ſucceſsful, was to gain the opinion and eſteem of the <hi>publick and authorized interpreter</hi> of them, and the Authority of adding to them what Doctrine ſhe pleaſed under the Title of <hi>Traditions</hi> or <hi>Definitions.</hi> For by this means, ſhe might both ſerve her ſelf of all thoſe cauſes of Scripture, which might be drawn to caſt a favourable countenance upon Her ambitious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, which in caſe the Scripture had been aboliſhed, ſhe could not have done; and yet be ſecure enough of
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:57896:39"/>having either her Power limitted, or her corruptions and abuſes reformed by them; this being once ſetled in the minds of men, that <hi>unwritten Doctrines, if propoſed by her, were to be received with equal reverence to thoſe that were written:</hi> and that <hi>the ſenſe of Scripture was not that which ſeemed to mens reaſon and underſtanding to be ſo, but that which the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>ſhould declare to be ſo, ſeemed in never ſo unreaſonable, and incongruous.</hi> The matter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once thus ordered, and the holy Scriptures being made in effect not your Directors and Judges (no farther than you pleaſe) but your <hi>Servants and Inſtruments,</hi> always preſt and in readineſs to advance your deſigns, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled wholly with minds ſo qualified to prejudice or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peach them; it is ſafe for you to put a Crown on their head, and a Reed in their Hands, and to bow before them, and cry, <hi>Hail King of the</hi> Jews! to pretend a great deal of <hi>eſteem, and reſpect, and reverence</hi> to them, as here you do. But to little purpoſe is verbal reverence without entire ſubmiſſion and ſincere obedience; and, as our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour ſaid of ſome, ſo the Scripture, could it ſpeak, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve would ſay to you, Why <hi>call ye me Lord, Lord, and do not that which I command you?</hi> Caſt away the vain and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogant pretence of <hi>Infallibility,</hi> which makes your Errors incurable. Leave Picturing God, and Worſhiping him by Pictures. <hi>Teach not for Doctrine the Commandments of men.</hi> Debar not the Laity of the Teſtament of Chriſt's Blood. Let your publick <hi>Prayers,</hi> and <hi>Pſalms</hi> and <hi>Hymes</hi> be in ſuch Language as is for the Edification of the Aſſiſtants. Take not from the Clergy that Liberty of Marriage which Chriſt hath left them. Do not impoſe upon men that <hi>Humility of Worſhiping Angels</hi> which S. <hi>Paul</hi> condemns. Teach no more proper Sacrifices of Chriſt but one. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge them <hi>that Die in Chriſt to be bleſſed, and to reſt from their Labours.</hi> Acknowledge the Sacrament after Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration, to be Bread and Wine, as well as Chriſts Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and Blood. Acknowledge the gift of continency without Marriage not to be given to all. Let not the Weapons of your Warfare be Carnal; ſuch as are Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cres, Treaſons, Perſecutions, and in a word all means
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:57896:40"/>either violent or fraudulent: Theſe and other things, which the Scripture commands you, do, and then we ſhall willingly give you ſuch Teſtimony as you deſerve; but till you do ſo, to talk of eſtimation, reſpect, and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the Scripture, is nothing elſe but talk.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. For neither is that true which you pretend, <hi>That we poſſeſs the Scripture from you, or take it upon the integrity of your Cuſtody,</hi> but upon <hi>Univerſal Tradition,</hi> of which you are but a little part. Neither, If it were true that <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants</hi> acknowledged, <hi>The integrity of it to have been guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by your alone Cuſtody,</hi> were this any argument of your reverence towards them. For firſt, you might preſerve them entire, not for want of Will, but of Power to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt them, <hi>as it is a hard thing to Poyſon the Sea.</hi> And then having prevailed ſo far with men, as either not to look at all into them, or but only through ſuch ſpectacles as you ſhould pleaſe to make for them, and to ſee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in them, though as clear as the Sun, if it any way made againſt you, you might keep them entire, without any thought or care to conform your Doctrine to them, or reform it by them (which were indeed to reverence the Scriptures) but out of a perſuaſion, that you could qualifie them well enough with your gloſſes and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations, and make them ſufficiently conformable to your preſent Doctrine, at leaſt, in their judgment, who were prepoſſeſſed with this perſuaſion, that <hi>your Church was to judge of the ſenſe of Scripture, not to be judged by it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. Whereas you ſay, <hi>No cauſe imaginable could avert your will from giving the function of Supream and ſole judge to holy Writ, but that the thing is impoſſible, and that by this means controverſies are encreaſed and not ended.</hi> What indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent and unprejudiced man may not eaſily conceive ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cauſe which (I do not ſay does, but certainly) may prevert your Wills, and avert your underſtandings from ſubmitting your Religion and Church to a <hi>Tryal by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> I mean the great and apparent and unavoidable danger which by this means you would fall into, of loſing the Opinion which men have of your Infallibility, and conſequently your Power and Authority over mens Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:57896:40"/>and all that depends upon it; ſo that though <hi>Diana of the Epheſians</hi> be cryed up, yet it may be feared that with a great many among you (though I cenſure or judge no man) the other cauſe which wrought upon <hi>Demetrius</hi> and the <hi>Craftsmen,</hi> may have with you alſo the more effectual, though more ſecret influence: and that is, that <hi>by this craft we have our living;</hi> by this craft, I mean of keeping your Proſelytes from an indifferent Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al of your Religion by Scripture, and making them yield up and captivate their judgment unto yours.</p>
                     <p>As for the impoſſibility of Scriptures being the ſole Judge of Controverſies, that is, <hi>the ſole rule for man to judge them by</hi> (for we mean nothing elſe) you only affirm it without proof, as if the thing were evident of it ſelf. And therefore I, conceiving the contrary to be more evident, might well content my ſelf to deny it without refutation. Yet I cannot but deſire you to tell me, If Scripture cannot be the Judge of any Controverſie, how ſhall that touching the <hi>Church and the Notes of it</hi> be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined? And if it be the ſole Judge of this one, why may it not of others? Why not of All? Thoſe only excepted wherein the Scripture it ſelf is the ſubject of the Queſtion, which cannot be determined but by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural reaſon, the only Principle, beſide Scripture, which is common to Chriſtians.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Then for the Imputation of <hi>increaſing contentions and not ending them,</hi> Scripture is innocent of it; as alſo this Opinion; <hi>That Controverſies are to be decided by Scripture.</hi> For if men did really and ſincerely ſubmit their judgments to Scripture, and that only, and would require no more of any man but to do ſo, it were impoſſible but that all Controverſies, touching things neceſſary and very profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſhould be ended: and if others were continued or increaſed, it were no matter.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. In the next Words we have direct <hi>Boyes-play;</hi> a thing given with one hand and taken away with the other; an acknowledgment made in one line, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted in the next. <hi>We acknowledge</hi> (ſay you) <hi>Scripture to be a perfect rule, for as much as a writing can be a Rule,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:57896:41"/>only we deny that it excludes unwritten Tradition.</hi> As if you ſhould have ſaid, we acknowledge it to be as perfect a Rule as a writing can be; only we deny it to be as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect a Rule as a writing may be. Either therefore you muſt revoke your acknowledgment, or retract your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractation of it; for both cannot poſſibly ſtand together. For if you will ſtand to what you have granted, That <hi>Scripture is as perfect a Rule of Faith as a Writing can be:</hi> you muſt then grant it both ſo <hi>Compleat,</hi> that it needs no addition, and ſo <hi>evident,</hi> that it needs no interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: For both theſe properties are requiſite to a <hi>perfect rule;</hi> and a Writing is capable of both theſe properties.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. That both theſe Properties are requiſite to a <hi>perfect rule,</hi> it is apparent: Becauſe that is not perfect in any kind which wants ſome parts belonging to its integrity: As he is not a perfect man that wants any part appertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Integrity of a Man; and therefore that which wants any acceſſion to make it a perfect rule, of its ſelf is not a perfect Rule. And then, the end of a <hi>rule</hi> is to regulate and direct. Now every inſtrument is more or leſs perfect in its kind, as it is more or leſs fit to attain the end for which it is ordained: But nothing obſcure or unevident while it is ſo, is fit to regulate and direct them to whom it is ſo: Therefore it is requiſite alſo to a <hi>rule</hi> (ſo far as it is a Rule) to be evident; otherwiſe indeed it is no <hi>rule,</hi> becauſe it cannot ſerve for direction. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude therefore, that both theſe properties are required to a perfect Rule: both to be ſo compleat as to need no Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; and to be ſo evident as to need no Interpretation.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Now that a Writing is capable of both theſe perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, it is ſo plain, that I am even aſhamed to prove it. For he that denies it muſt ſay, That <hi>ſomething may be ſpoken which cannot be written.</hi> For if ſuch a compleat and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident rule of Faith may be delivered by word of mouth, as you pretend it may, and is; and whatſoever is delivered by word of mouth may alſo be written; then ſuch a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat and evident rule of Faith may alſo be written. If you will have more light added to the Sun, anſwer me then to theſe Queſtions. Whether your Church can ſet down in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:57896:41"/>all theſe, which ſhe pretends to be Divine unwritten Traditions, and add them to the verities already written? And whether ſhe can ſet us down ſuch interpretations of all obſcurities in the Faith as ſhall need no farther in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations? If ſhe cannot, then ſhe hath not that pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er which you pretend ſhe hath, of being an <hi>Infallible Teacher of all Divine verities,</hi> and an infallible interpreter of obſcurities in the Faith: for ſhe cannot teach us all Divine verities, if ſhe cannot write them down; neither is that an interpretation which needs again to be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted: If ſhe can; Let her do it, and then we ſhall have a writing, not only capable of, but, actually endowed with both theſe perfections, of being both ſo compleat as to need no Addition, and ſo evident as to need no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation. Laſtly, whatſoever your Church can do or not do, no man can without Blaſphemy deny, that <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> if he had pleaſed, could have writ us a rule of Faith ſo plain and perfect, as that it ſhould have wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted neither any part to make up its integrity, nor any clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to make it ſufficiently intelligible: And if Chriſt could have done this, then the thing might have been done; a writing there might have been indowed with both theſe properties. Thus therefore I conclude, a wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting may be ſo perfect a Rule, as to need neither Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion nor Interpretation; But the <hi>Scripture you acknowledge a perfect Rule for as much as a writing can be a Rule,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it needs neither Addition nor Interpretation.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. You will ſay, <hi>that though a writing be never ſo perfect a Rule of Faith, yet it muſt be beholden to Tradition to give it this Teſtimony, that it is a Rule of Faith, and the Word of God.</hi> I anſwer: Firſt, there is no abſolute neceſſity of this. For God might, if he thought good, give it the atteſtation of perpetual Miracles. Secondly, that it is one thing to be a perfect Rule of Faith, another to be proved ſo unto us. And thus though a writing could not be proved to us to be a perfect rule of Faith, by its own ſaying ſo, for nothing is proved true by being ſaid or writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in a Book, but only by Tradition which is a thing cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible of it ſelf; yet it may be ſo in it ſelf, and contain
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:57896:42"/>all the material Objects, all the particular Articles of our Faith, without any dependance upon Tradition; even this alſo not excepted, that <hi>this Writing doth contain the rule of Faith.</hi> Now when <hi>Proteſtants</hi> affirm againſt <hi>Papiſts,</hi> that <hi>Scripture is a perfect rule of Faith,</hi> their mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is not, that by Scripture all things abſolutely may be proved, which are to be believed: For it can never be proved by Scripture to a gainſayer, that there is a God, or that the Book called Scripture is the Word of God; For he that will deny theſe Aſſertions when they are ſpok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, will believe them never a whit the more becauſe you can ſhew them written: But their meaning is, that the Scripture, to them which preſuppoſe it Divine, and a Rule of Faith, as <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Proteſtants</hi> do, contains all the material Objects of Faith; is a compleat and Total, and not only an imperfect and a partial Rule.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. <hi>But every Book and Chapter, and Text of Scripture is Infallible and wants no due perfection, and yet excludes not the Addition of other Book, of Scripture; Therefore the perfection of the whole Scripture excludes not the Addition of unwritten Tradition.</hi> I anſwer; Every Text of Scripture though it have the perfection belonging to a Text of Scripture, yet it hath not the perfection requiſite to a <hi>perfect Rule of Faith;</hi> and that only is the perfection which is the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of our diſcourſe. So that this is to abuſe your Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der with the ambiguity of the word <hi>Perfect.</hi> In effect, as if you ſhould ſay, a Text of Scripture may be a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Text, though there be others beſide it; therefore the whole Scripture may be a perfect Rule of Faith, though there be other parts of this Rule, beſides the Scripture, and though the Scripture be but a part of it.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. The next Argument to the ſame purpoſe is, for Sophiſtry, Coſin German to the former. <hi>When the firſt Books of Scripture were written, they did not exclude unwrit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Tradition: Therefore now alſo, that all the Books of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are written, Traditions are not excluded.</hi> The ſenſe of which Argument (if it have any) muſt be this. When only a part of the Scripture was written, then a part of the Divine Doctrine was unwritten; Therefore now
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:57896:42"/>when all the Scripture is written, yet ſome part of the Divine Doctrine is yet unwritten. If you ſay, your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion is not that it is ſo, but without diſparagement to Scripture, may be ſo: without diſparagement to the truth of Scripture, I grant it; but without diſparagement to the Scriptures being a <hi>perfect Rule,</hi> I deny it. And now the Queſtion is not of the Truth, but the perfection of it; which are very different things, though you would fain confound them. For Scripture might very well be all true, though it contain not all neceſſary Divine Truth. But unleſs it do ſo, it cannot be a <hi>perfect Rule of Faith;</hi> for that which wants any thing is not perfect. For I hope you do not imagine, that we conceive any Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy between Gods Word Written and unwritten, but that both might very well ſtand together. All that we ſay is this, that we have reaſon to believe that God <hi>de Facto,</hi> hath ordered the matter ſo, that all the Goſpel of Chriſt, the whole Covenant between God and Man, is now Written. Whereas if he had pleaſed, he might ſo have diſpoſed it, that part might have been written, and part unwritten: but then he would have taken order, to whom we ſhould have had recourſe, for that part of it which was not written; which ſeeing he hath not done (as the Progreſs ſhall demonſtrate) it is evident he hath left no part of it unwritten. We know no man there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that ſays, It were any injury to the written Word to be joyned with the unwritten, if there were any where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with it might be joyned; but that we deny. The fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a Keeper may very well conſiſt with the Authority of the thing committed to his Cuſtody. But we know no one Society of Chriſtians that is ſuch a faithful Keeper as you pretend. The Scripture it ſelf was not kept ſo faithfully by you, but that you ſuffered infinite variety of Readings to creep into it; all which could not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly be Divine, and yet, in ſeveral parts of your Church, all of them, until the laſt Age, were ſo eſteemed. The interpretations of obſcure places of Scripture, which without Queſtion, the Apoſtles taught the Primitive Chriſtians are wholly loſt; there remains no certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:57896:43"/>ſcarce of any one. Thoſe <hi>Worlds of Miracles,</hi> which our Saviour did, which were not written, for want of writing are vaniſhed out of the memory of men. And many profitable things which the Apoſtles taught and writ not, as that which S. <hi>Paul</hi> glances at, in his <hi>ſecond Epiſtle to the</hi> Theſalon. of the <hi>cauſe of the hindrance of the coming of Antichriſt,</hi> are wholly loſt and extinguiſhed. So unfaithful or negligent hath been this keeper of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine verities; whoſe eyes, like the Keepers of <hi>Iſrael</hi> (you ſay) have <hi>never Slumbred nor Slept.</hi> Laſtly, we deny not but a Judge and a Law might well ſtand together, but we deny that there is any ſuch Judge of Gods appointment. Had he intended any ſuch Judge, he would have named him, leſt otherwiſe (as now it is) our <hi>Judge of Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies</hi> ſhould be our greateſt Controverſie.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. Ad 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. §.] In your ſecond Paragraph, you ſum up thoſe arguments wherewith you intend to prove, that <hi>Scripture alone cannot be Judge in Controverſies.</hi> Wherein I profeſs unto you before hand, that you will fight without an Adverſary. For though <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> being warranted by ſome of the Fathers, have called Scripture the <hi>Judge of Controverſies;</hi> and you in ſaying here, That Scripture <hi>alone</hi> cannot be Judge, imply that it may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in ſome ſenſe a Judge, though not alone: Yet to ſpeak properly (as men ſhould ſpeak when they write of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies in Religion) the Scripture is not a Judge of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies, but <hi>a Rule only and the only Rule for Chriſtians to judge them by.</hi> Every man is to Judge for himſelf with the <hi>Judgment of Diſcretion,</hi> and to chooſe either his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion firſt, and then his Church, as we ſay: or as you, his Church firſt, and then his Religion. But by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of both ſides, every man is to judge and chooſe: and the Rule whereby he is to guide his choice, if he be a natural man, is Reaſon, if he be already a Chriſtian, Scripture, which we ſay is the Rule to judge Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies by. Yet not all ſimply, but all the Controverſies of Chriſtians, of thoſe, that are already agreed upon This firſt Principle that, <hi>the Scripture is the Word of God.</hi> But that there is any man, or any company of men appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:57896:43"/>to be judge for all men, that we deny, and that I believe you will never prove. The very truth is, we ſay no more in this matter, than evidence of Truth hath made you confeſs in plain terms in the beginning of this chap. <hi>viz</hi> That <hi>Scripture is a perfect Rule of Faith, for as much as a writing can be a Rule.</hi> So that all your reaſons where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by you labour to dethrone the Scripture from this office of <hi>Judging,</hi> we might let paſs as impertinent to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion which we maintain, and you have already grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; yet out of courteſie we will conſider them.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. Your firſt is this; <hi>a Judge muſt be a perſon fit to end Controverſies, but the Scripture is not a perſon, nor fit to end Controverſies, no more than the Law would be without the Judges, therefore though it may be a Rule it cannot be a Judge.</hi> Which concluſion I have already granted. Only my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt is, that you will permit Scripture to have the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of a Rule, that is, to be fit to direct every one that will make the beſt uſe of it, to that end for which it was ordained. And that is as much as we need deſire. For as if I were to go a Journey and had a guide which could not Err, I needed not to know my way: ſo on the other ſide, if I know my way or have a plain rule to know it by, I ſhall need no guide. Grant therefore Scripture to be ſuch a Rule, and it will quickly take away all neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of having an Infallible guide. But <hi>without a living Judge it will be no fitter</hi> (you ſay) <hi>to end Controverſies, than the Law alone to end Suits.</hi> I anſwer, if the Law were plain and perfect, and men honeſt and deſirous to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand aright, and obey it, he that ſays it were not fit to end Controverſies, muſt either want underſtanding him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, or think the World wants it. Now the Scripture, we pretend, <hi>in things neceſſary is plain and perfect,</hi> and men, we ſay, are obliged, under pain of Damnation, to ſeek the true ſenſe of it, and not to wreſt it to their precon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Phanſies. Such a Law therefore to ſuch men can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be very fit to end all Controverſies, neceſſary to be ended. For others that are not ſo, they will end when the World ends, and that is time enough.</p>
                     <pb n="78" facs="tcp:57896:44"/>
                     <p n="13">13. Your next encounter is with them, who acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging the Scripture a Rule only and not a Judge, make the Holy Ghoſt, ſpeaking in Scripture, the judge of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies. Which you diſprove by ſaying, <hi>That the Holy Ghoſt ſpeaking only in Scripture is no more intelligible to us, than the Scripture in which he ſpeaks.</hi> But by this reaſon neither the <hi>Pope,</hi> nor a Council can be a Judge neither. For firſt, denying the Scriptures, the writings of the Holy Ghoſt, to be Judges, you will not I hope offer to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, that their decrees, the writings of men are more capable of this function: the ſame exceptions at leaſt, if not more, and greater lying againſt them as do againſt Scripture. And then what you Object againſt the Holy Ghoſt, ſpeaking in Scripture, to exclude him from this office, The ſame I return upon them and their decrees, to debar them from it; that they ſpeaking unto us on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in their decrees, are no more intelligible than the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees in which they ſpeak. And therefore if the Holy Ghoſt ſpeaking in Scripture may not be a judge for this reaſon; neither may they, ſpeaking in their decrees, be Judges for the ſame Reaſon. <hi>If the</hi> Popes <hi>decrees</hi> (you will ſay) <hi>be obſcure, he can explain himſelf, and ſo the Scripture cannot.</hi> But the Holy Ghoſt, that ſpeaks in Scripture, can do ſo, if he pleaſe, and when he is pleaſed will do ſo. In the mean time it will be fit for you to wait his leiſure, and to be content, that thoſe things of Scripture which are plain ſhould be ſo, and thoſe which are obſcure ſhould remain obſcure, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til he pleaſe to declare them. Beſides he can (which you cannot warrant me of the <hi>Pope</hi> or a Coucil) ſpeak at firſt ſo plainly, that his Words ſhall need no farther ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation; and ſo in things neceſſary we believe he has done. And if you ſay, <hi>the Decrees of Councils touching Controverſies, though they be not the Judge, yet they are the Judges Sentence:</hi> So, I ſay, the Scripture, though not the Judge, is the Sentence of the Judge. When therefore you conclude, <hi>That to ſay a Judge is neceſſary for deciding Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies, about the meaning of Scripture, is as much as to ſay, he is neceſſary to decide what the Holy Ghoſt ſpeaks in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:</hi>
                        <pb n="79" facs="tcp:57896:44"/>This I grant is true, but I may not grant that a Judge (ſuch a one as we diſpute of) is neceſſary either to do the one, or the other. For if the Scripture (as it is in things neceſſary) be plain, why ſhould it be more neceſſary to have a judge to interpret them in plain places, than to have a judge to interpret the meaning of a Councils de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees, and others to interpret their Interpretations, and others to interpret theirs, and ſo on for ever? And where they are not plain, there if we, uſing diligence to find the truth, do yet miſs of it and fall into Error, there is no danger in it. They that Err, and they that do not Err may both be ſaved. So that thoſe places which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain things neceſſary, and wherein Error were dangerous, need no Infallible interpreter becauſe they are plain: and thoſe that are obſcure need none becauſe they contain not things neceſſary, neither is Error in them dangerous.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The Law-maker ſpeaking in the Law,</hi> I grant it, <hi>is no more eaſily underſtood than the Law it ſelf,</hi> for his Speech is nothing elſe but the Law: I grant it <hi>very neceſſary, that beſides the Law-maker ſpeaking in the Law, there ſhould be other Judges to determine Civil and Criminal Controverſies, and to give every man that Juſtice which the Law allows him.</hi> But your Argument drawn from hence to ſhew a neceſſity of a viſible Judge in Controverſies of Religion. I ſay is Sophiſtical: and that for many Reaſons.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. Firſt, Becauſe the variety of Civil caſes is infinite, and therefore there cannot be poſſibly Laws enough pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for the determination of them: and therefore there muſt be a Judge to ſupply out of the Principles of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon the interpretation of the Law, where it is defective. But the Scripture (we ſay) is a perfect Rule of Faith, and therefore needs no ſupply of the defects of it.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. Secondly, To execute the Letter of the Law, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to rigour, would be many times unjuſt, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is need of a Judge to moderate it; whereof in Religion there is no uſe at all.</p>
                     <p n="16">16. Thirdly, In Civil and Criminal cauſes the parties have for the moſt part ſo much intereſt, and very often ſo little honeſty, that they will not ſubmit to a Law though
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:57896:45"/>never ſo plain, if it be againſt them; or will not ſee it to be againſt them, though it be ſo never ſo plainly: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as if men were honeſt, and the Law were plain and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to all caſes, there would be little need of Judges. Now in matters of Religion, when the Queſtion is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther every man be a fit Judge and chooſer for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, we ſuppoſe men honeſt, and ſuch as underſtand the difference between a Moment and Eternity. And ſuch men, we conceive, will think it highly concerns them to be of the true Religion, but nothing at all that this or that Religion ſhould be the true. And then we ſuppoſe that all the neceſſary points of Religion are plain and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, and conſequently every man in this cauſe to be a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent Judge for himſelf; becauſe it concerns himſelf to judge right as much as Eternal happineſs is worth. And if through his own default he judge amiſs he alone ſhall ſuffer for it.</p>
                     <p n="17">17. Fourthly, in Civil Controverſies we are obliged only to external paſſive obedience, and not to an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and active. We are bound to obey the Sentence of the Judge, or not to reſiſt it, but not always to believe it juſt. But in matters of Religion, ſuch a Judge is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired whom we ſhould be obliged to believe, to have judged right. So that in Civil Controverſies every honeſt underſtanding man is fit to be a Judge; But in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on none but he that is infallible.</p>
                     <p n="18">18. Fifthly, in Civil Cauſes there is means and power, when the Judge has decreed, to compel men to obey his Sentence: otherwiſe, I believe, Laws alone, would be to as much purpoſe, for the ending of differences, as Laws and Judges both. But all the Power in the World is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fit to convince, nor able to compel a mans Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to conſent to any thing. Worldly terror may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail ſo far as to make men profeſs a Religion which they believe not, (ſuch men I mean, who know not that there is a Heaven provided for Martyrs, and a Hell for thoſe that diſſemble ſuch truths as are neceſſary to be profeſſed:) But to force, either any man to believe what he believes not, or any honeſt man to diſſemble what he does believe
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:57896:45"/>(if God commands him to profeſs it,) or to profeſs what he does not believe, all the Powers in the World are too weak, with all the Powers of Hell, to aſſiſt them.</p>
                     <p n="19">19. Sixthly, in Civil Controverſies the caſe cannot be ſo put, but there may be a Judge to end it, who is not a party: In Controverſies of Religion, it is in a manner impoſſible to be avoided but the Judge muſt be a party. For this muſt be the firſt, whether he be a Judge or no, and in that he muſt be a party. Sure I am, the <hi>Pope,</hi> in the Controverſies of our time, is a chief party; for it highly concerns him, even as much as his Popedom is worth, not to yield any one point of his Religion to be Erroneous. And he is a man ſubject to like paſſions with other men. And therefore we may juſtly decline his Sentence, for fear temporal reſpects ſhould either blind his judgment, or make him pronounce againſt it.</p>
                     <p n="20">20. Seventhly, in Civil Controverſies, it is impoſſible <hi>Titius</hi> ſhould hold the land in queſtion and <hi>Sempronius</hi> too: and therefore either the Plantiff muſt injure the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, by diſquieting his poſſeſſion, or the Defendant wrong the Plantiff by keeping his right from him. But in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies of Religion the Caſe is otherwiſe. I may hold my Opinion and do you no wrong, and you yours and do me none. Nay we may both of us hold our Opinion, and yet do our ſelves no harm; provided, the difference be not touching any thing neceſſary to Salvation, and that we love truth ſo well, as to be diligent to inform our Conſcience, and conſtant in following it.</p>
                     <p n="21">21. Eightly, For the ending of Civil Controverſies, who does not ſee it is abſolutely neceſſary, that not only Judges ſhould be appointed, but that it ſhould be known and unqueſtioned who they are? Thus all the Judges of our Land are known men, known to be Judges, and no man can doubt or queſtion, but theſe are the Men. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe if it were a diſputable thing, who were theſe Judges, and they had no certain warrant for their Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, but only ſome Topical congruities, would not any man ſay ſuch Judges, in all likelihood, would rather mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply Controverſies, then end them?</p>
                     <pb n="82" facs="tcp:57896:46"/>
                     <p n="22">22. Ninthly, and laſtly, For the deciding of Civil Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies men may appoint themſelves a judge. But in matters of Religion, this office may be given to none but whom God hath deſigned for it: who doth not always give us thoſe things which we conceive moſt expedient for our ſelves.</p>
                     <p n="23">23. So likewiſe if our Saviour, the King of Heaven, had intended that all Controverſies in Religion ſhould be by ſome Viſible Judge finally determined, who can doubt, but in plain terms he would have expreſſed himſelf about this matter? He would have ſaid plainly. <hi>The Biſhop of</hi> Rome <hi>I have appointed to decide all emergent Controverſies.</hi> For that our Saviour deſigned the <hi>Biſhop of Rome</hi> to this Office, and yet would not ſay ſo, nor cauſe it to be written—<hi>ad Rei memoriam</hi>—by any of the <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> or <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> ſo much as once; but leave it to be drawn out of uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Principles, by thirteen or fourteen more uncertain conſequences, He that can believe it, let him. All theſe Reaſons, I hope, will convince you, that though we have, and have great neceſſity of, Judges in Civil and Criminal cauſes: yet you may not conclude from thence, that there is any publick authorized Judge to determine Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies in Religion, nor any neceſſity there ſhould be any.</p>
                     <p n="24">24. <hi>But the Scripture ſtands in need of ſome watchful and unerring eye to guard it, by means of whoſe aſſured vigilancy we may undoubtedly receive it ſincere and pure.</hi> Very true, but this is no other than the watchful Eye of Divine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence: the goodneſs whereof will never ſuffer, that the Scriptures ſhould be depraved and corrupted, but that in them ſhould be always extant a conſpicuous and plain way to Eternal happineſs. Neither can any thing be more palpably unconſiſtent with his goodneſs, than to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer Scripture to be undiſcernably corrupted in any mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of moment, and yet to exact of men the belief of thoſe verities, which without their fault, or knowledge, or poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of prevention, were defaced out of them. So that God requiring of men to believe Scripture in its purity, ingages himſelf to ſee it preſerved in ſufficient purity, and you need not fear but he will ſatisfie his ingagement.
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:57896:46"/>You ſay, <hi>we can have no aſſurance of this but your Churches Vigilancy.</hi> But if we had no other we were in a hard caſe; for who could then aſſure us that your Church has been ſo vigilant, as to guard Scripture from any the leaſt alteration? There being various Lections in the ancient Copies of your Bibles, what ſecurity can your new raiſed <hi>Office of Aſſurance</hi> give us, that, that reading is true which you now receive, and that falſe which you reject? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly they that anciently received and made uſe of theſe divers Copies, were not all guarded by the Churches vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilancy from having their Scripture altered from the purity of the Original in many places. For of different readings, it is not in nature impoſſible that all ſhould be falſe, but more than one cannot poſſibly be true. Yet the want of ſuch a protection was no hindrance to their Salvation, and why then ſhall the having of it be neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for ours? But then this Vigilancy of your Church, what means have we to be aſcertain'd of it? Firſt, the thing is not evident of it ſelf; which is evident, becauſe many do not believe it. Neither can any thing be pretended to give evidence to it, but only ſome places of Scripture; of whoſe incorruption more than any other what is it that can ſecure me? If you ſay the Churches vigilancy, you are in a Circle, proving the Scriptures uncorrupted by the Churches vigilancy, and the Churches vigilancy by the incorruption of ſome places of Scripture, and again the incorruption of thoſe places by the Churches vigilan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. If you name any other means, than that means which ſecures me of the Scriptures incorruption in thoſe places, will alſo ſerve to aſſure me of the ſame in other places. For my part, abſtracting from Divine Providence, which will never ſuffer the way to Heaven to be blocked up or made inviſible, I know no other means (I mean no other natural and rational means) to be aſſured hereof, than I have that any other Book is uncorrupted. For though I have a greater degree of rational and humane Aſſurance of that than this, in regard of divers conſiderations which make it more credible, <hi>That the Scripture hath been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved from any material alteration;</hi> yet my aſſurance of

                     <p n="25">25. To the next argument the Reply is obvious; <hi>That though we do not believe the Books of Scripture to be Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal becauſe they ſay ſo,</hi> (For other Books that are not Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical may ſay they are, and thoſe that are ſo may ſay nothing of it:) yet we believe not this upon the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of your Church, but upon the Credibility of <hi>Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Tradition,</hi> which is a thing <hi>Credible of it ſelf,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore fit to be reſted on; whereas the Authority of your Church is not ſo. And therefore your reſt thereon is not rational but meerly voluntary. I might as well reſt upon the judgment of the next man I meet, or upon a chance of a Lottery for it. For by this means I only know I might Err, but by relying on you I know I ſhould Err. But yet (to return you one ſuppoſe for another) ſuppoſe I ſhould for this and all other things ſubmit to her directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, how could ſhe aſſure me that I ſhould not be miſ-led by doing ſo? She pretends indeed infallibility herein, but how can ſhe aſſure us that ſhe hath it? What, by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. That you ſay cannot aſſure us of its own Infallibility, and therefore not of yours. What then, by Reaſon? That you ſay may deceive in other things, and why not in this? How then will ſhe aſſure us hereof, By ſaying ſo? Of this very affirmation there will remain the ſame Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion ſtill, How it can prove it ſelf to be infallibly true. Neither can there be an end of the like multiplied De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, till we reſt in ſomething evident of it ſelf, which demonſtrates to the World that this Church is infallible. And ſeeing there is no ſuch Rock for the Infallibility of this Church to be ſetled on, it muſt of neceſſity, like the Iſland of <hi>Delos,</hi> flote up and down for ever. And yet upon this point according to <hi>Papiſts</hi> all other Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies in Faith depend.</p>

To the 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, §.] The ſum and ſubſtance of the Ten next Paragraphs is this, <hi>That it appears, by the Confeſſions of ſome</hi> Proteſtants, <hi>and the Contentions of others, that the Queſtions about the Canon of Scripture, what it is: and about the Various reading and
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:57896:47"/>Tranſlations of it, which is true and which not, are not to be determined by Scripture, and therefore that all Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies of Religion are not decidable by Scripture.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="27">27. To which I have already anſwered ſaying, That when Scripture is affirmed to be the rule by which all Controverſies of Religion are to be decided, Thoſe are to be excepted out of this generality which are concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Scripture it ſelf. For as that general ſaying of Scripture, <hi>He hath put all things under his Feet,</hi> is moſt true, though yet S. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, <hi>That when it is ſaid, he hath put all things under him, it is manifeſt he is excepted who did put all things under him:</hi> So when we ſay that all Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies of Religion are decidable by the Scripture, it is manifeſt to all, but <hi>Cavillers,</hi> that we do and muſt except from this generality, thoſe which are <hi>touching the Scripture it ſelf.</hi> Juſt as a Merchant ſhewing a Ship of his own, may ſay, all my ſubſtance is in this Ship; and yet never intended to deny, that his Ship is part of his ſubſtance, nor yet to ſay that his Ship is in it ſelf. Or as a man may ſay, that a whole Houſe is ſupported by the Foundation, and yet never mean to exclude the Foundation from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a part of the Houſe, or to ſay that it is ſupported by it ſelf. Or as you your ſelves uſe to ſay, that the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> is head of the whole Church, and yet would think us but Captious Sophiſters ſhould we infer from hence, that either you made him no part of the whole, or elſe made him head of himſelf. Your negative concluſion therefore, that theſe <hi>Queſtions touching Scripture, are not decidable by Scripture,</hi> you needed not have cited any Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities, nor urged any reaſon to prove it; it is evident of it ſelf, and I grant it without more ado. But your Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rollary from it, which you would inſinuate to your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wary reader, <hi>that therefore they are to be decided by your, or any Viſible Church,</hi> is a meer inconſequence, and very like his collection, who becauſe <hi>Pamphilus</hi> was not to have <hi>Glycerium</hi> for his Wife, preſently concluded that he muſt have her; as if there had been no more men in the World but <hi>Pamphilus</hi> and himſelf. For ſo you as if there were nothing in the World capable of this Office, but the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:57896:48"/>Scripture, or the preſent Church, having concluded againſt Scripture, you conceive, but too haſtily, that you have concluded for the Church. But the truth is, neither the one nor the other have any thing to do with this matter. For firſt, the Queſtion <hi>whether ſuch or ſuch a Book be Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Scripture,</hi> though it may be decided negatively out of Scripture, by ſhewing apparent and irreconcilable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions between it and ſome other Book confeſſedly Canonical; yet affirmatively it cannot but only by the Teſtimonies of the ancient Churches: any Book being to be received as undoubtedly Canonical, or to be doubted of as uncertain, or rejected as Apocryphal, according as it was received, or doubted of, or rejected by them. Then for the Queſtion, <hi>of various readings which is the true,</hi> it is inreaſon evident and confeſſed by your own <hi>Pope,</hi> that there is no poſſible determination of it, but only by compariſon with ancient Copies. And laſtly for Controverſies about different Tranſlations of Scripture, the Learned have the ſame means to ſatisfie themſelves in it, as in the Queſtions which happen about the Tranſlation of any other Author, that is, skill in the Language of the Original, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring Tranſlations with it. In which way if there be no certainty, I would know what certainty you have, that your <hi>Doway</hi> Old, and <hi>Rhemiſh</hi> New <hi>Teſtament</hi> are true Tranſlations? And then for the unlearned thoſe on your Side are ſubject to as much, nay the very ſame uncertainty with thoſe on ours. Neither is there any reaſon imaginable, why an ignorant <hi>Engliſh Proteſtant</hi> may not be as ſecure of the Tranſlation of our Church, that it is free from Error, if not abſolutely, yet in matters of moment, as an ignorant <hi>Engliſh Papiſt</hi> can be of his <hi>Rhemiſh Teſtament,</hi> or <hi>Doway Bible.</hi> The beſt direction I can give them is to compare both together, &amp; where there is no real difference (as in the Tranſlation of controverted places I believe there is very little) there to be confident, that they are right; where they differ, therefore to be prudent in the choice of the guides they follow. Which way of proceeding, if it be ſubject to ſome poſſible Error, is it the beſt that either we, or you have; and it is not required that we uſe any bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than the beſt we have.</p>
                     <pb n="87" facs="tcp:57896:48"/>
                     <p n="28">28. You will ſay, <hi>Dependance on your Churches infallibility is a better.</hi> I anſwer, it would be ſo, if we could be infallibly cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that your Church is infallible, that is, if it were either evident of it ſelf, and ſeen by its own light, or could be reduced unto and ſetled upon ſome Principle that is ſo. But ſeeing you your ſelves do not ſo much as pretend, to enforce us to the belief hereof, by any proofs infallible and convincing, but only to induce us to it, by ſuch as are, by your confeſſion, only probable, and <hi>prudential motives;</hi> certainly it will be to very little purpoſe, to put off your uncertainty for the firſt turn, and to fall upon it at the ſecond: to pleaſe your ſelves in building your Houſe upon an imaginary Rock, when you your ſelves ſee and confeſs, that this very Rock ſtands it ſelf at the beſt but upon a frame of Timber. I anſwer ſecondly, that this cannot be a better way, becauſe we are infallibly certain that your Church is not infallible, and indeed hath not the real preſcription of this priviledge, but only pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth her ſelf with a falſe imagination and vain preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it: as I ſhall hereafter demonſtrate by may unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable arguments.</p>
                     <p n="31">31. But, <hi>ſeeing the belief of the Scripture is a neceſſary thing, and cannot be proved by Scripture, how can the Church of</hi> England <hi>teach, as ſhe doth, Art.</hi> 6. <hi>That all things neceſſary are contained in Scripture?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="32">32. I have anſwered this already. And here again I ſay, That all but Cavillers will eaſily underſtand the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Article to be, That all the Divine Verities, which Chriſt revealed to his Apoſtles, and the Apoſtles taught the Churches, are contained in Scripture. That is, all the material Objects of our Faith; whereof the Scripture is none, but only the means of conveying them unto us: which we believe not finally, and for it ſelf, but for the matter contained in it. So that if men did believe the Doctrine contained in Scripture, it ſhould no way hinder their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, not to know whether their were any Scripture or no. Thoſe Barbarous Nations <hi>Irenaeus</hi> ſpeaks of were in this caſe, and yet no doubt but they might be ſaved. The end that God aims at, is the belief of the Goſpel,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:57896:49"/>the Covenant between God and Man; the Scripture he hath provided as a means for this end, and this alſo we are to believe, but not as the laſt Object of our Faith, but as the inſtrument of it. When therefore we ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe to the 6. <hi>Art.</hi> you muſt underſtand that, by <hi>Articles of Faith,</hi> they mean the final and ultimate Objects of it, and not the means and inſtrumental Objects;</p>
                     <p n="33">33. But, <hi>Proteſtants agree not in aſſigning the Canon of Holy Scripture.</hi> Luther <hi>and</hi> Illyricus <hi>reject the Epiſtle of S.</hi> James. Kemnitius, <hi>and other Luth. the ſecond of</hi> Peter, <hi>the ſecond and third of</hi> John. <hi>The Epiſtle to the</hi> Heb. <hi>the Epiſtle of</hi> James, <hi>of</hi> Jude, <hi>and the Apocalyps. Therefore without the Authority of the Church, no certainty can be had what Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is Canonical.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="34">34. So alſo the <hi>Ancient Fathers,</hi> and not only Fathers, but <hi>whole Churches</hi> differed about the certainty of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the very ſame Books: and by their difference ſhewed, they knew no neceſſity of conforming themſelves herein to the judgment of your or any Church. For had they done ſo, they muſt have agreed all with that Church, and conſequently among themſelves. Now I pray tell me plainly, Had they ſufficient certainty what Scripture was Canonical, or had they not? If they had not, it ſeems there is no ſuch great harm or danger in not hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch a certainty whether ſome Books be Canonical or no, as you require: If they had, why may not <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants,</hi> notwithſtanding their differences, have ſufficient certainty hereof, as well as the Ancient Fathers and Churches, notwithſtanding theirs?</p>
                     <p n="35">35. You proceed. And whereas the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> of <hi>England</hi> in the 6. <hi>Art.</hi> have theſe Words, <hi>In the name of the Holy Scripture we do underſtand thoſe Books, of whoſe Authority was never any doubt in the Church;</hi> you demand, <hi>what they mean by them? Whether that by the Churches con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent they are aſſured what Scriptures be Canonical?</hi> I Anſwer for them. Yes, they are ſo. And whereas you infer from hence, <hi>This is to make the Church Judge:</hi> I have told you already, That <hi>of this Controverſie we make the Church the Judge;</hi> but not the preſent Church, much leſs
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:57896:49"/>the preſent <hi>Roman</hi> Church, but the conſent and Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the <hi>Ancient and Primitive Church.</hi> Which though it be but a highly probable inducement, and no demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive enforcement, yet methinks you ſhould not deny but it may be a ſufficient ground of Faith: Whoſe Faith, even of the Foundation of all your Faith, your Churches Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, is built laſtly and wholly upon <hi>Prudential Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="36">36. But <hi>by this Rule the whole Book of</hi> Eſther <hi>muſt quit the Canon; becauſe it was excluded by ſome in the Church:</hi> by <hi>Melito, Athanaſius,</hi> and <hi>Gregory Nazianzen.</hi> Then for ought I know he that ſhould think he had reaſon to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude it now, might be ſtill in the Church as well as <hi>Melito, Athanaſius, Nazianzen</hi> were. And while you thus inveigh againſt <hi>Luther,</hi> and charge him with Luci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferian Hereſies, for doing that which you in this very place confeſs that Saints in Heaven before him have done, <hi>are you not partial and a Judge of evil thoughts?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="37">37. <hi>Luther's</hi> cenſures of <hi>Eccleſiaſtes, Job,</hi> and the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,</hi> though you make ſuch Tragedies with them, I ſee none of them but is capable of a tolerable conſtruction, and far from having in them any Fundamental Hereſie. He that condemns him for ſaying, the Book of <hi>Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtes is not full, That it hath many abrupt things,</hi> condemns him, for ought I can ſee, for ſpeaking truth. And the reſt of the cenſure is but a bold and blunt expreſſion of the ſame thing. The Book of <hi>Job</hi> may be a true Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and yet as many true Stories are, and have been an Argument of a Fable to ſet before us an example of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience. And though the Books of the Prophets were not written by themſelves, but by their Diſciples, yet it does not follow that they were written caſually: (Though I hope you will not damn all for Hereticks, that ſay, ſome Books of Scripture were written caſually.) Neither is there any reaſon they ſhould the ſooner be called in queſtion for being written by their Diſciples, ſeeing being ſo writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten they had atteſtation from themſelves. Was the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie of <hi>Jeremy</hi> the leſs Canonical, for being written by <hi>Baruch?</hi> Or becauſe S. <hi>Peter</hi> the Maſter dictated the
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:57896:50"/>Goſpel, and S. <hi>Mark</hi> the Scholar writ it, is it the more likely to be called in Queſtion?</p>
                     <p n="38">38. But leaving <hi>Luther,</hi> you return to our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non of Scripture; And tell us, that in <hi>the New Teſtament, by the above mentioned rule, (of whoſe Authority was never any doubt in the Church) divers Books muſt be diſcanonized.</hi> Not ſo. For I may believe even thoſe queſtioned Books to have been written by the Apoſtles and to be Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical: but I cannot in Reaſon believe this of them ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly, as of <hi>thoſe Books which were never queſtioned.</hi> At leaſt I have no warrant to damn any man that ſhall doubt of them or deny them now: having the example of Saints in Heaven, either to juſtifie, or excuſe ſuch their doubting or denial.</p>
                     <p n="39">39. You obſerve in the next place, that <hi>our ſixth Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, ſpecifying by name all the Books of the</hi> Old Teſtament, <hi>ſhuffles over theſe of the</hi> New <hi>with this generality—All the Books of the</hi> New Teſtament, <hi>as they are commonly received, we do receive, and account them Canonical:</hi> And in this you fancy to your ſelf <hi>a myſtery of iniquity.</hi> But if this be all the ſhuffling that the Church of <hi>England</hi> is guilty of, I believe the Church, as well as the King, may give for her Motto, <hi>Honi ſoit qui mal y penſe.</hi> For all the Bibles which ſince the Compoſing of the Articles have been uſed and allowed by the <hi>Church of England,</hi> do teſtifie and even proclaim to the World, that by—<hi>Commonly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,</hi> they meant, <hi>received by the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>and other Churches before the Reformation.</hi> I pray take the pains to look in them, and there you ſhall find the Books which the Church of <hi>England</hi> counts Apocryphal marked out and ſevered from the reſt, with this Title in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, <hi>The Books called Apocrypha;</hi> and with this cloſe or Seal in the End, <hi>The End of the Apocrypha.</hi> And having told you by name, and in particular, what Books only She Eſteems <hi>Apocryphal,</hi> I hope you will not put Her to the trouble of telling you that the reſt are in Her judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>Canonical.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="40">40. <hi>But if by Commonly received, She meant, by the Church of</hi> Rome; <hi>Then by the ſame reaſon, muſt She receive divers Books of the</hi> Old Teſtament <hi>which She rejects.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="91" facs="tcp:57896:50"/>
                     <p n="41">41. Certainly a very good Conſequence. The Church of <hi>England</hi> receives the Books of the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> receives; Therefore ſhe muſt receive the Books of the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> which ſhe receives. As if you ſhould ſay, If you will do as we, in one thing, you muſt in all things. If you will pray to God with us, you muſt pray to Saints with us. If you hold with us, when we have reaſon on our ſide, you muſt de ſo, when we have no reaſon.</p>
                     <p n="43">43. But, <hi>with what Coherence can we ſay in the former part of the Article, That by Scripture we mean thoſe Books that were never doubted of; and in the latter ſay, We receive all the Books of the</hi> New Teſtament, <hi>as they are commonly received, whereas of them many were doubted?</hi> I anſwer. When they ſay, <hi>of whoſe Authority there was never any doubt in the Church,</hi> They mean not, thoſe only of whoſe Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority there was ſimply no doubt at all, by any man in the Church; But ſuch as were not at any time doubted of by the whole Church, or by all Churches, but had atteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, though not Univerſal, yet at leaſt ſufficient to make conſidering men receive them for Canonical. In which number they may well reckon thoſe Epiſtles which were ſometimes doubted of by ſome, yet whoſe number and Authority was not ſo great, as to prevail againſt the contrary ſuffrages.</p>
                     <p n="44">44. But, <hi>if to be commonly received, paſs for a good Rule to know the Canon of the</hi> New Teſtament <hi>by, why not of the Old?</hi> You conclude many times very well, but ſtill when you do ſo, it is out of principles which no man grants. For who ever told you, that to be <hi>commonly</hi> received is a good Rule to know the Canon of the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> by? Have you been trained up in Schools of ſubtilty, and cannot you ſee a great difference, between theſe two, We receive the Books of the <hi>New Teſtament as they are</hi> commonly received, and we receive thoſe that are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly received, <hi>becauſe they are ſo?</hi> To ſay this, were indeed to make, <hi>being commonly received,</hi> a Rule or Reaſon to know the Canon by. But to ſay the former, doth no more make it a Rule, than you ſhould make the Church of <hi>England</hi> the rule of your receiving them, if you ſhould
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:57896:51"/>ſay, as you may, The Books of the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> we receive for Canonical, as they are received by the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="45">45. You demand, <hi>upon what infallible ground we agree with</hi> Luther <hi>againſt you, in ſome, and with you againſt</hi> Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>in others?</hi> And I alſo demand upon what infallible ground you hold your Canon, and agree neither with us, nor <hi>Luther?</hi> For ſure your differing from us both, is of it ſelf no more apparently reaſonable, than our agreeing with you in part, and in part with <hi>Luther.</hi> If you ſay, your Churches Infallibility is your ground: I demand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain ſome Infallible ground both for the Churches Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility, and for this, that <hi>Yours is the Church;</hi> and ſhall never ceaſe multiplying demands upon demands, until you ſettle me upon a Rock; I mean, give ſuch an anſwer, whoſe Truth is ſo evident that it needs no further evidence. If you ſay, <hi>This is Univerſal Tradition:</hi> I reply, your Churches Infallibility is not built upon it, and that the Canon of Scripture, as we receive it, is. For we do not profeſs our ſelves ſo abſolutely, and undoubtedly certain; neither do we urge others to be ſo, of thoſe Books, which have been doubted, as of thoſe that never have.</p>
                     <p n="46">46. The Concluſion of your Tenth. §. is, That <hi>the Divinity of a writing cannot be known from it ſelf alone, but by ſome extrinſecal Authority:</hi> Which you need not prove, for no Wiſe Man denies it. But then this authority is that of <hi>Univerſal Tradition,</hi> not of your Church. For to me it is altogether as <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, that the Goſpel of <hi>Saint Matthew</hi> is the Word of God, as that all which your Church ſays is true.</p>
                     <p n="47">47. That Believers of the Scripture, by conſidering the Divine matter, the excellent precepts, the glorious promiſes contained in it, may be confirmed in their Faith, of the Scriptures Divine Authority; and that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other inducements and inforcements hereunto, internal arguments have their place and force, certainly no man of underſtandeng can deny. For my part I profeſs, if the Doctrine of the Scripture were not as good, and as fit to come from the Fountain of goodneſs, as
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:57896:51"/>the Miracles, by which it was confirmed, were great, I ſhould want one main pillar of my Faith, and for want of it, I fear ſhould be much ſtaggered in it. Now this and nothing elſe did the <hi>Doctor</hi> mean in ſaying, <hi>The Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever ſees, by that glorious beam of Divine light which ſhines in Scripture, and by many internal Arguments, that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is of Divine Authority. By this</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>he ſees it,</hi> that is, he is moved to, and ſtrengthened in his belief of it: and by this partly, not wholly; by this, not alone, but with the concurrence of other Arguments. He that will quarrel with him for ſaying ſo, muſt find fault with the <hi>Maſter of the Sentences,</hi> and all his <hi>Scholars,</hi> for they all ſay the ſame.</p>
                     <p n="48">48. In the next Diviſion, out of your liberality, you will ſuppoſe, that Scripture, like to a corporal light, is <hi>by it ſelf alone</hi> able to determine and move our underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to aſſent: yet notwithſtanding this ſuppoſal, <hi>Faith ſtill</hi> (you ſay) <hi>muſt go before Scripture, becauſe as the light is viſible only to thoſe that have eyes: ſo the Scripture only to thoſe that have the Eye of Faith.</hi> But to my underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, if Scripture do move and determine our Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to aſſent, then the Scripture, and its moving muſt be before this aſſent, as the cauſe muſt be before its own ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; now this very aſſent is nothing elſe but Faith, and Faith nothing elſe than the Underſtandings aſſent. And therefore (upon this ſuppoſal) Faith doth, and muſt ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally proceed from Scripture, as the effect from its proper cauſe: and the influence and efficacy of Scripture is to be preſuppoſed before the aſſent of Faith, unto which it moves and determines, and conſequently if this ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of yours were true, there ſhould need no other means precedent to Scripture to beget Faith, Scripture it ſelf being able (as here you ſuppoſe) to determine and move the underſtanding to aſſent, that is to believe them, and the Verities contained in them. Neither is this to ſay, that the Eyes with which we ſee, are made by the light by which we ſee. For you are miſtaken much, if you conceive that in this compariſon, Faith anſwers to the Eye. But if you will not pervert it, the Analogy
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:57896:52"/>muſt ſtand thus-; Scripture muſt anſwer to light; The Eye of the Soul, that is the Underſtanding, or the facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of aſſenting, to the bodily Eye; And laſtly aſſenting or believing to the Act of ſeeing. As therefore the light, determining the Eye to ſee, though it preſuppoſes the Eye which it determines, as every Action doth the Object on which it is imployed, yet it ſelf is preſuppoſed and ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent to the Act of ſeeing, as the cauſe is always to its effect: So, if you will ſuppoſe that Scripture, like light, moves the underſtanding to aſſent, The Underſtanding (that's the Eye and Objection which it works) muſt be before this influence upon it; But the Aſſent, that is the belief whereof the Scripture moves, and the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is moved, which anſwers to the Act of ſeeing, muſt come after. For if it did aſſent already, to what purpoſe ſhould the Scripture do that which was done before? Nay indeed how were it poſſible it ſhould be ſo, any more than a Father can beget a Son that he hath already? Or an Architect build an Houſe that is built already? Or than this very world can be made again before it be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>made? Tranſubſtantiation indeed is fruitful of ſuch Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters. But they that have not ſworn themſelves to the defence of Error, will eaſily perceive, that <hi>Jam factum facere,</hi> and <hi>Factum infectum facere,</hi> are equally impoſſible. But I digreſs.</p>
                     <p n="49">49. The cloſe of this Paragraph, is a fit cover for ſuch a Diſh. There you tell us, That <hi>if there muſt be ſome other means precedent to Scripture to beget Faith, this can be no other than the Church.</hi> By the Church, we know you do, and muſt underſtand the <hi>Roman Church:</hi> ſo that in effect you ſay, no man can have Faith, but he muſt be moved to it by your Churches Authority. And that is to ſay, that the King and all other <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> to whom you write, though they verily think they are Chriſtians and believe the Goſpel, becauſe they aſſent to the truth of it, and would willingly Die for it, yet indeed are Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels and believe nothing. The Scripture tells us, <hi>The Heart of man knoweth no Man, but the Spirit of Man which is in him.</hi> And who are you, to take upon you to make us
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:57896:52"/>believe, that we do not believe, what we know we do? But if I may think verily that I believe the Scripture, and yet not believe it; how know you that you believe the <hi>Roman Church?</hi> I am as verily, and as ſtrongly perſuad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that I believe the Scripture, as you are that you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Church. And if I may be deceived, why may not you? Again, what more ridiculous, and againſt ſenſe and experience, than to affirm, That there are not Millions amongſt you and us that believe, upon no other reaſon than their Education, and the authority of their Parents and Teachers, and the Opinion they have of them? The tenderneſs of the ſubject, and aptneſs to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive impreſſions, ſupplying the defect and imperfection of the Agent! And will you proſcribe from Heaven all thoſe believers of your own Creed, who do indeed lay the Foundation of their Faith (for I cannot call it by any other name) no deeper than upon the Authority of their Father, or Maſter, or Pariſh Prieſt? Certainly, if theſe have no true Faith, your Church is very full of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels. Suppoſe <hi>Xaverius</hi> by the Holineſs of his Life had converted ſome <hi>Indians</hi> to Chriſtianity, who could (for ſo I will ſuppoſe) have no knowledge of your Church but from him, and therefore muſt laſt of all build their Faith of the Church upon their Opinion of <hi>Xaverius:</hi> Do theſe remain as very <hi>Pagans</hi> after their Converſion, as they were before? Are they brought to aſſent in their Souls, and obey in their Lives the Goſpel of Chriſt, only to be Tantalized and not ſaved, and not benefited but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded by it, becauſe, forſooth, it is a man and not the Church that begets Faith in them? What if their motive to believe be not in reaſon ſufficient? Do they therefore not believe what they do believe, becauſe they do it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſufficient motives? They chooſe the Faith imprudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly parhaps, but yet they do chooſe it. Unleſs you will have us believe that, that which is done, is not done, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is not done upon good reaſon: which is to ſay, that never any man living ever did a fooliſh action. But yet I know not why the Authority of one Holy Man, which apparently has no ends upon me, joyned with the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:57896:53"/>goodneſs of the Chriſtian Faith, might not be a far great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and more rational motive to me to embrace Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, than any I can have to continue in <hi>Paganiſm.</hi> And therefore for ſhame, if not for Love of Truth, you muſt recant this fancy when you write again: and ſuffer true Faith to be many times, where your Churches Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility has no hand in the begetting of it. And be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to tell us hereafter, that we believe not enough, and not go about to perſuade us, we believe nothing, for fear with telling us what we know to be manifeſtly falſe, you ſhould gain only this, <hi>Not to be believed when you ſpeak truth.</hi> Some pretty Sophiſms you may happily bring us to make us believe, we believe nothing: but Wiſe men know that Reaſon againſt Experience is alwaies Sophiſtical. And therefore as he that could not anſwer <hi>Zeno's</hi> ſubtilties a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the exiſtence of Motion, could yet confute them by doing that, which he pretended could not be done: So if you ſhould give me a hundred Arguments to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade me, becauſe I do not believe Tranſubſtantiation, I do not believe in God, and the <hi>Knots</hi> of them I could not unty, yet I ſhould cut them in pieces with doing that, and knowing that I do ſo, which you pretend I cannot do.</p>
                     <p n="53">53. It is ſuperfluous for you to prove <hi>out of</hi> S. Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius, <hi>and</hi> Auſtine <hi>that we muſt receive the ſacred Canon upon the credit of Gods Church.</hi> Underſtanding by Church, as here you explain your ſelf, <hi>The Credit of Tradition.</hi> And that not the Tradition of the Preſent Church, which we pretend may deviate from the Ancient, but <hi>ſuch a Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, which involves an evidence of Fact, and from Hand to Hand, from Age to Age, bringing us up to the times and Perſons of the Apoſtles, and our Saviour Himſelf, commeth to be confirmed by all theſe Miracles, and other Arguments, whereby they convinced their Doctrine to be true.</hi> Thus you. Now prove the Canon of Scripture which you receive by ſuch Tradition and we will allow it. Prove your whole Doctrine, or the Infallibility of your Church by ſuch a Tradition, and we will yield to you in all things. Take the alledged places of S. <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> and S. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> in this
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:57896:53"/>ſenſe, (which is your own,) and they will not preſs us any thing at all. We will ſay, with <hi>Athanaſius, That only four Goſpels are to be received, becauſe the Canons of the Holy and</hi> Catholick <hi>Church</hi> (underſtand of <hi>all Ages</hi> ſince the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the Canon) <hi>have ſo determined.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="54">54. We will ſubſcribe to S. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> and ſay, That <hi>we alſo would not believe the Goſpel, unleſs the Authority of the Catholick Church did move us,</hi> (meaning by the Church, <hi>the Church of all Ages,</hi> and that ſucceſſion of Chriſtians which takes in <hi>Chriſt himſelf</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles.</hi>) Neither would <hi>Zwinglius</hi> have needed to cry out upon this ſaying, had he conceived as you now do, that by the Catholick Church, the Church of all Ages, fince Chriſt, was to be underſtood. As for the Council of <hi>Carthage,</hi> it may ſpeak not of ſuch Books only, as were certainly Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, and for the regulating of Faith, but alſo of thoſe which were only profitable, and lawful to be read in the Church. Which in <hi>England</hi> is a very ſlender Argument that the Book is Canonical, where every body knows that Apocryphal Books are read as well as Canonical. But howſoever, if you underſtand by Fathers, not only their immediate Fathers and Predeceſſors in the Goſpel, but the ſucceſſion of them from the Apoſtles; they are right in the Theſis, that <hi>whatſoever is received from theſe Fathers, as Canonical, is to be ſo eſteemed;</hi> Though in the applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, to this or that particular Book they may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily Err, and think that Book received as Canonical, which was only received as Profitable to be read; and think that Book, received alwaies, and by all, which was rejected by ſome, and doubted of by many.</p>

And this aſſurance of the Scriptures incorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is common to us with him; we therefore are as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain hereof as S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> was, and that I hope was certain enough. Yet if this does not ſatisfie you, I ſay farther, We are as certain hereof as your own <hi>Pope Sixtus Quintus</hi> was. He in his <hi>Preface to his Bible</hi> tells us,
<note n="b" place="margin">
                           <hi>In hac Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni textus perveſtigatione, ſatis perſpicue inter omnes conſtat, nullum argumentum eſſe certius ac firmius, quam antiquorem probatorum codicum latinorum fidem,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ſic</hi> Sixtus in praefat.</note> That <hi>in the preveſtigation of the true and genuine Text, it was perſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly manifeſt to all men, that there was no Argument more firm and certain to be relied upon, than the Faith of Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Books.</hi> Now this ground we have to build upon as well as He had: and therefore our certainty is as great, and ſtands upon as certain ground as his did.</p>
                     <p n="56">56. This is not all I have to ſay in this matter. For I will add moreover, that we are as certain in what Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage the Scripture is uncorrupted, as any man in your Church was, until <hi>Clement</hi> the 8th ſet forth your own approved <hi>Edition of your Vulgar</hi> Tranſlation. For you do not, nor cannot, without extreme impudence deny, that until then, there was great variety of Copies currant in divers parts of your Church, and thoſe very frequent in various lections: all which Copies might poſſibly be falſe in ſome things, but more than one ſort of them, could not poſſibly be true in all things. Neither were it leſs
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:57896:54"/>impudence to pretend, that any man in your Church, could until <hi>Clements</hi>'s time have any certainty what that one true Copy and reading was (if there were any one perfectly true.) Some indeed that had got <hi>Sixtus his Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> might after the Edition of that very likely think themſelves cock-ſure of a perfect true uncorrupted Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation, without being beholden to <hi>Clement;</hi> but how fouly they were abuſed and deceived that thought ſo, the Edition of <hi>Clemens,</hi> differing from that of <hi>Sixtus</hi> in a great multitude of places, doth ſufficiently demonſtrate.</p>
                     <p n="57">57. This certainty therefore in what Language the Scripture remains uncorrupted, is it neceſſary to have it, or is it not? If it be not, I hope we may do well enough without it. If it be neceſſary, what became of your Church for 1500 Years together? All which time you muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs ſhe had no ſuch certainty: no one man being able truly and upon good ground to ſay, <hi>This or that Copy of the Bible is pure, and perfect, and uncorrupted in all things.</hi> And now at this preſent, though ſome of you are grown to a higher degree of Preſumption in this point, yet are you as far as ever, from any true and real, and rational aſſurance of the abſolute purity of your Authentick Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation: which I ſuppoſe my ſelf to have proved unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerably in divers places.</p>

<pb n="100" facs="tcp:57896:55"/>but the</hi> Latine <hi>Interpreters are innumerable.

Amongſt all theſe Interpretations</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>let the</hi> Italian <hi>be preferred: for it keeps cloſer to the Letter, and is perſpicuous in the ſenſe.</hi> Yet ſo far was the Church of that time from perſuming up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the abſolute purity and perfection, even of this beſt Tranſlation, that S. <hi>Hierome</hi> thought it neceſſary to make a new Tranſlation of the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> out of the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi> Fountain, (which himſelf teſtifies in his Book <hi>de Viris Illuſtribus,</hi>) And to correct the vulgar verſion of the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> according to the truth of the Original <hi>Greek;</hi> amending many Errors which had crept into it, whether by the miſtake of the Author, or the negligence of the Tranſcribers; which work he undertook and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed at the requeſt of <hi>Damaſus,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome. You conſtrain me</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to make a new Work of an old: that after the Copies of the Scriptures have been diſperſed through the whole World, I ſhould ſit as it were an Arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor amongſt them, and becauſe they vary among themſelves, ſhould determine what are thoſe things (in them) which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with the</hi> Greek <hi>verity.</hi> And after: <hi>Therefore this preſent Preface promiſes the four Goſpels only corrected by col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation with</hi> Greek <hi>Copies. But that they might not be very diſſonant from the Cuſtome of the</hi> Latine <hi>reading, I have ſo tempered with my ſtile, the Tranſlation of the Ancients, that, thoſe things amended wich did ſeem to change the ſenſe, other things I have ſuffered to remain as they were.</hi> So that in this matter <hi>Proteſtants</hi> muſt either ſtand or fall with the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church.</p>

<pb n="101" facs="tcp:57896:55"/>do Err, at leaſt ſome of them, becauſe their Tranſlations are contrary. It ſeems then the Faith, and conſequently the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of</hi> Proteſtants <hi>relies upon fallible and uncertain grounds.</hi>

This again upon the Miniſter's being a true Prieſt. That ſuch or ſuch a man is Prieſt, not himſelf, much leſs any other can have any poſſible certainty: for it depends upon a great many contingent and uncertain ſuppoſals. He that will pretend to be certain of it, muſt undertake to know for a certain all theſe things that follow.</p>
                     <p n="64">64. Firſt that he was Baptized with due matter. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, with the due form of Words, (which he cannot know, unleſs he were both preſent and attentive.) Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he muſt know that he was Baptized with due Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that is, that the Miniſter of his Baptiſm was not a ſecret <hi>Jew,</hi> nor a <hi>Moore,</hi> nor an <hi>Atheiſt,</hi> (of all which kinds, I fear experience gives you juſt cauſe to fear, that <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> have Prieſts not a few,) but a Chriſtian in Heart, as well as Profeſſion; (otherwiſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving the Sacrament to be nothing, in giving it be could intend to give nothing.) nor a <hi>Samoſatenian,</hi> nor an <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian:</hi> but one that was capable of having due intention, from which they that believe not the Doctrine of the Trinity are excluded by you. And laſtly, that he was neither Drunk not Diſtracted at the adminiſtration of the Sacrament, nor out of negligence or malice omitted his intention.</p>
                     <p n="65">65. Fourthly, he muſt undertake to know, that the Biſhop which ordained him Prieſt, ordained him compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with due Matter, Form and Intention: and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that he again was neither <hi>Jew,</hi> nor <hi>Moore,</hi> nor <hi>Atheiſt,</hi> nor liable to any ſuch exception, as is unconſiſtent with due Intention in giving the Sacrament of Orders.</p>
                     <pb n="102" facs="tcp:57896:56"/>
                     <p n="66">66. Fifthly, he muſt undertake to know, that the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop which made him Prieſt, was a Prieſt himſelf, for your rule is, <hi>Nihil dat quod non habet:</hi> And conſequently, that there was again none of the former nullities in his Baptiſm, which might make him incapable of Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; nor no invalidity in his Ordination, but a true Prieſt to ordain him again, the requiſite matter and form and due intention all concurring.</p>
                     <p n="67">67. Laſtly, he muſt pretend to know the ſame of him that made him Prieſt, and him that made Him Prieſt, even until he comes to the very Fountain of Prieſthood. For take any one in the whole train and ſucceſſion of Ordainers, and ſuppoſe him, by reaſon of any defect, only a ſuppoſed and not a true Prieſt, then according to your Doctrine he could not give a true, but only a ſuppoſed Prieſthood; and they that receive it of him, and again, they that derive it from them, can give no better than they received; receiving nothing but a name and ſhadow, can give nothing but a name and ſhadow: and ſo from Age to Age, from Generation to Generation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing equivocal Fathers, beget only equivocal Sons; No Principle in Geometry being more certain than this, That <hi>the unſuppliable defect of any neceſſary Antecedent, muſt needs cauſe a nullity of all thoſe Conſequences which depend upon it.</hi> In fine, to know this one thing, you muſt firſt know Ten Thouſand others, whereof not any one is a thing that can be known; there being no neceſſity that it ſhould be true, which only can qualifie any thing for an Object of Science, but only, at the beſt, a high degree of proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility that it is ſo. But then, that of Ten Thouſand pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bables no one ſhould be falſe; that of Ten Thouſand requiſites, whereof any one may fail, not one ſhould be wanting, this to me is extremely improbable, and even Couſin-german to Impoſſible. So that the aſſurance here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is like a Machine compoſed of an innumerable multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of pieces, of which it is ſtrangely unlikely but ſome will be out of order; and yet if any one be ſo, the whole Fabrick of neceſſity falls to the ground. And he that ſhall put together, and maturely conſider all the poſſible
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:57896:56"/>ways of lapſing, and nullifying a Prieſthood in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> I believe will be very inclinable to think, that it is an hundred to one, that amongſt a hundred ſeeming Prieſts, there is not one true one. Nay, that it is not a thing very improbable, that amongſt thoſe many milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which make up the <hi>Romiſh Hierarchy,</hi> there are <hi>not twenty</hi> true. But be the truth in this what it will be, once this is certain, that They which makes mens Salvation (as you do) depend upon Prieſtly Abſolution, and this again (as you do) upon the Truth and reality of the Prieſthood that gives it, and this laſtly upon a great multitude of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent uncertainties, are not the fitteſt men in the World, to object to others as a horrible crime, <hi>That they make mens Salvation depend upon fallible and uncertain Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi> And let this be the firſt retortion of your Argument.</p>
                     <p n="68">68. But ſuppoſe this difficulty aſſoiled, and that an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel from Heaven ſhould aſcertain you (for other aſſurances you can have none) that the Perſon, you make uſe of, is a true Prieſt, and a competent Miniſter of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Pennance; yet ſtill the doubt will remain, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he will do you that good which he can do, whether he will pronounce the abſolving words with intent to abſolve you! For perhaps he may bear you ſome ſecret malice, and project to himſelf your damnation, for a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat <hi>Italian</hi> revenge. Parhaps (as the tale is of a Prieſt that was lately burnt in <hi>France</hi>) he may upon ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions have compacted with the Devil to give no Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with Intention. Laſtly, he may be (for ought you can poſſibly know) a ſecret <hi>Jew,</hi> or <hi>Moor,</hi> or <hi>Anti-Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitarian,</hi> or perhaps ſuch a one as is ſo far from intending your forgiveneſs of ſins and Salvation by this Sacrament, that in his heart he laughs at all theſe things, and thinks Sin nothing, and Salvation a word. All theſe doubts you muſt have clearly reſolved (which can hardly be done but by another Revelation,) before you can upon good grounds aſſure your ſelf, that your true Prieſt gives you true and effectual abſolution. So that when you have done as much as God requires for your Salvation, yet can you by no means be ſecure, but that you may have the
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:57896:57"/>ill luck to be Damned: which is to make Salvation a matter of chance, and not of choice, and which a man may fail of, not only by an ill life, but by ill Fortune. Verily a moſt comfortable Doctrine for a conſidering man lying upon Death bed, who either feels or fears that his repentance is but attrition only, and not contrition, and conſequently believes that if he be not abſolved real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by a true Prieſt, he cannot poſſibly eſcape damnation. Such a man for his comfort, you tell, firſt (you that will have <hi>mens Salvation depend upon no uncertainties,</hi>) that though he verily believe that his ſorrow for ſins is a true ſorrow, and his purpoſe of amendment a true purpoſe; yet he may deceive himſelf, perhaps it is not, and if it be not, he muſt be damned. Yet you bid him hope well: But <hi>Spes eſt rei incertae nomen.</hi> You tell him ſecondly, that though the party he confeſſes to, ſeem to be a true Prieſt, yet for ought he knows, or for ought himſelf knows, by reaſon of ſome ſecret undiſcernable invalidity in his Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm or Ordination, he may be none: and if he be none, he can do nothing. This is a hard ſaying, but this is not the worſt. You tell him thirdly, that he may may be in ſuch a ſtate that he cannot, or if he can, that he will not give the Sacrament with due Intention: and if he does not, all's in vain. Put caſe a man by theſe conſiderations ſhould be caſt into ſome agonies; what advice, what comfort would you give him? Verily I know not what you could ſay to him, but this; that firſt for the Qualification required on his part, he might know that he deſired to have true ſorrow, and that that is ſufficient. But then if he ſhould ask you, why he might not know his ſorrow to be a true ſorrow, as well as his deſire to be ſorrowful, to be a true deſire, I believe you would be put to ſilence. Then ſecondly, to quiet his fears, concerning the Prieſt and his intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you ſhould tell him, by my advice, that Gods goodneſs (which will not ſuffer him to damn men for not doing better than their beſt,) will ſupply all ſuch defects as to humane endeavours were unavoidable. And therefore though his Prieſt were indeed no Prieſt, yet to him he ſhould be as if he were one: and if he gave Abſolution
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:57896:57"/>without Intention, yet in doing ſo he ſhould hurt himſelf only and not his penitent. This were ſome comfort in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and this were to ſettle mens Salvation upon reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able certain grounds. But this I fear you will never ſay; for this were to reverſe many Doctrines eſtabliſhed by your Church, and beſides to degrade your Prieſthood from a great part of their honour, by leſſening the ſtrict ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of the Laities dependance upon them. For it were to ſay, that <hi>the Prieſts Intention is not neceſſary to the obtaining of abſolution;</hi> which is to ſay, that it is not in the Parſons power to damn whom he will in his Pariſh, becauſe by this Rule, God ſhould ſupply the defect which his malice had cauſed. And beſides it were to ſay, that <hi>Infants dying without Baptiſm might be ſaved,</hi> God ſupplying the want of Baptiſm which to them is unavoidable. But beyond all this, it were to put into my mouth a full and ſatisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing anſwer to your Argument, which I am now return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſo that in anſwering my objection you ſhould anſwer your own. For then I ſhould tell you, that it were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together as abhorrent from the goodneſs of God, and as repugnant to it, to ſuffer an ignorant Lay-mans Soul to periſh, meerly for being miſled by an undiſcernable falſe Tranſlation, which yet was commended to him by the Church, which (being of neceſſity to credit ſome in this matter) he had reaſon to rely upon either above all other, or as much as any other, as it is to damn a penitent ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner for a ſecret defect in that deſired Abſolution, which his Goſtly Father perhaps was an <hi>Atheiſt</hi> and could not give him, or was a villiain and would not. This anſwer therefore, which alone would ſerve to comfort your pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent in his perplexities, and to aſſure him that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not fail of Salvation if he will not, for fear of inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies you muſt forbear. And ſeeing you muſt, I hope you will come down from the Pulpit, and Preach no more againſt others for <hi>making mens Salvation depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on fallible and uncertain grounds,</hi> leſt by judging others, you make your ſelves and your own Church inexcuſable, who are ſtrongly guilty of this fault, above all the men and Churches of the World: whereof I have already
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:57896:58"/>given you two very pregnant demonſtrations, drawn from your preſumptions tying God and Salvation to your Sacraments; And the efficacy of them to your Prieſts Qualifications and Intentions.</p>
                     <p n="69">69. Your making the Salvation of Infants depend on Baptiſm a Caſual thing, and in the power of man to confer, or not confer, would yield me a Third of the ſame nature. And your ſuſpending the ſame on the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptizers intention a Fourth. And laſtly your making the Real preſence of Chriſt in the Euchariſt depend upon the caſualties of the Conſecrators true Prieſthood and Intention, and yet commanding men to believe it for certain that he is preſent, and to adore the Sacrament, which according to your Doctrine, for ought they can poſſibly know, may be nothing elſe but a piece of Bread, ſo expoſing them to the danger of Idolatry, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently of Damnation, doth offer me a Fiſth demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſame concluſion, if I thought fit to inſiſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them. But I have no mind to draw any more out of this Fountain; neither do I think it Charity to cloy the Reader with uniformity, when the Subject affords variety.</p>
                     <p n="70">70. Sixthly, therefore I return it thus. The Faith of <hi>Papiſts</hi> relies alone upon their Churches infallibility. That there is any Church infallible, and that theirs is it, they pretend not to believe, but only upon <hi>prudential mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives.</hi> Dependance upon prudential motives they confeſs to be obnoxious to a poſſibility of erring. What then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth but Truth, Faith, Salvation, and all muſt in them rely upon a fallible and uncertain ground!</p>
                     <p n="71">71. Seventhly, The Faith of <hi>Papiſts</hi> relies upon the Church alone. The Doctrine of the Church is delivered to moſt of them by their Pariſh Prieſt, or Ghoſtly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or at leaſt by a company of Prieſts, who for the moſt part ſure, are men and not Angels, in whom no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more certain than a moſt certain poſſibility to Err. What then remaineth but that Truth, Faith, Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation and all, muſt in them rely upon a fallible and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain ground.</p>
                     <pb n="107" facs="tcp:57896:58"/>
                     <p n="72">72. Eighthly thus. It is apparent and undeniable, that many Thouſands there are, who believe your Religion upon no better grounds, than a man may have for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief almoſt of any Religion. As ſome believe it, becauſe their Forefathers did ſo, and they were good People. Some, becauſe they were Chriſtened, and brought up in it. Some, becauſe it is the Religion of their Country, where all other Religions are perſecuted and profcribed. Some, becauſe <hi>Proteſtants</hi> cannot ſhew a perpetual ſucceſſion of Profeſſors of all their Doctrine. Some, becauſe the ſervice of your Church is more ſtately, and pompous, and magnificent. Some, becauſe they find comfort in it. Some, becauſe your Religion is farther ſpread, and hath more Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of it, than the Religion of <hi>Proteſtants.</hi> Some, becauſe <hi>your</hi> Prieſts <hi>compaſs Sea and Land to gain Proſelytes to it.</hi> Laſtly, an infinite number, by chance, and they know not why, but only becauſe they are ſure they are in the right. This which I ſay is a moſt certain experimented Truth, and if you will deal ingeniouſly, you will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny it. And without queſtion he that builds his Faith up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our <hi>Engliſh Tranſlation,</hi> goes upon a more prudent ground than any of theſe can, with reaſon, be pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be. What then can you alledge but that, with you, rather than with us, Truth and Faith and Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and all relies upon fallible and uncertain grounds.</p>
                     <p n="73">73. Ninthly. Your <hi>Rhemiſh</hi> and <hi>Doway</hi> Tranſlations are delivered to your Proſelytes, (ſuch I mean that are diſpenced with for the reading of them,) for the directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their Faith and Lives. And the ſame may be ſaid of your Tranſlations of the Bible into other national Languages, in reſpect of thoſe that are Licenſed to read them. This I preſume you will confeſs. And moreover, that theſe Tranſlations came not by inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but were the productions of humane Induſtry; and that not Angels, but men were the Authors of them. Men I ſay, meer men, ſubject to the ſame Paſſions and to the ſame poſſibility of erring with our Tranſlators. And then how does it not unavoidably follow, that in them which depend upon theſe Tranſlations for their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:57896:59"/>Faith, and Truth, and Salvation, and all relies upon fallible and uncertain grounds?</p>
                     <p n="74">74. Tenthly and laſtly (to lay the Axe to the Root of the Tree,) the <hi>Helena</hi> which you ſo fight for, your vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar Tranſlation, though ſome of you believe, or pretend to believe, it to be in every part and particle of it, the pure and uncorrupted Word of God; yet others among you, and thoſe as good and zealous Catholicks as you, are not ſo confident hereof.</p>
                     <p n="75">75. Firſt, for all thoſe who have made Tranſlations of the whole Bible or any part of it different many times in ſenſe from the Vulgar, as <hi>Lyranus, Cajetan, Pagnine, Arias, Eraſmus, Valla, Steuchus,</hi> and others, it is apparent and even palpable, that they never dreamt of any abſolute perfecti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on and authentical Infallibility of the <hi>Vulgar Tranſlation.</hi> For if they had, why did they in many places reject it and differ from it?</p>
                     <p n="76">76. <hi>Vega</hi> was preſent at the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> when that decree was made, which made the <hi>Vulgar Edition</hi> (then not extant any where in the World) <hi>authentical,</hi> and not to be rejected upon any pretence whatſoever. At the forming this decree <hi>Vega</hi> I ſay was preſent, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood the mind of the Council, as well as any man, and profeſſes that he was inſtructed in it by the <hi>Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi> of it, the <hi>Cardinal</hi> S. <hi>Cruce.</hi> And yet he hath writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten that <hi>the Council in this decree, meant to pronounce this Tranſlation free</hi> (not ſimply from all Error) <hi>but only from ſuch Errors, out of which any opinion pernicious to Faith and Manners might be collected.</hi> This, <hi>Andradius</hi> in his defence of that Council reports of <hi>Vega,</hi> and aſſents to it himſelf. <hi>Driedo,</hi> in his <hi>Book of the Tranſlation of Holy Scripture,</hi> hath theſe Words very pregnant and pertinent to the ſame purpoſe; <hi>The See Apoſtolick, hath approved or accepted</hi> Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roms <hi>Edition, not as ſo wholly conſonant to the Original, and ſo entire and pure and reſtored in all things, that it may not be lawful for any man, either by comparing it with the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to examine it, or in ſome places to doubt, whether or no</hi> Hierome <hi>did underſtand the true ſenſe of the Scripture; but only as an Edition to be preferred before all others then extant,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:57896:59"/>and no where deviating from the Truth in the Rules of Faith and good Life. Mariana,</hi> even where he is a moſt earneſt Advocate for the Vulgar Edition, yet acknowleges the imperfection of it in theſe Words,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Pro Edit. vulg.</hi> c. 21. p. 99.</note> 
                        <hi>The faults of the Vulgar Edition are not approved by the Decree of the Council of</hi> Trent, <hi>a multitude whereof we did collect from the varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Copies.</hi> And again, <hi>We maintain that the Hebrew and Greek, were by no means rejected by the</hi> Trent <hi>Fathers: And that the Latin Edition is indeed approved, yet not ſo, as if they did deny that ſome places might be Tranſlated more plainly, ſome more properly; whereof it were eaſie to produce innumerable examples.</hi> And this he there profeſſes to have <hi>learnt of</hi> Laines <hi>the then General of the Society:</hi> who was a great part of that Council, preſent at all the Actions of it, and of very great authority in it.</p>
                     <p n="77">77. To this ſo great authority he adds a reaſon of his opinion, which with all indifferent men will be of a far greater authority. <hi>If the Council</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>had purpoſed to approve an Edition in all reſpects, and to make it of equal authority and credit with the Fountains, certainly they ought with exact care firſt to have corrected the Errors of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter:</hi> which certainly they did not.</p>
                     <p n="78">78. Laſtly <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himſelf,

                           <hi>Bell. de verbo Dei</hi> l. 2. c. 11. p. 120.</note> though he will not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge any imperfection in the Vulgar Edition, yet he acknowledges that the caſe may, and does oft-times ſo fall out, that <hi>it is impoſſible to diſcern which is the true reading of the Vulgar Edition, but only by recourſe unto the Originals, and dependence upon them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="79">79. From all which it may evidently be collected, that though ſome of you flatter your ſelves with a vain imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the certain abſolute purity and perfection of your Vulgar Edition; yet the matter is not ſo certain, and ſo reſolved, but that the beſt Learned men amongſt you are often at a ſtand, and very doubtful ſometimes whether your Vulgar Tranſlation be true, and ſometimes whether this or that be your Vulgar Tranſlation, and ſometimes undoubtedly reſolved that your Vulgar Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation is no true Tranſlation, nor conſonant to the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal, as it was at firſt delivered. And what then can
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:57896:60"/>be alledged, but that out of your own grounds it may be inferred and inforced upon you, that not only in your Lay-men, but your Clergy-men and Scholars, Faith and Truth and Salvation and all depends upon fallible and uncertain grounds? And thus by Ten ſeveral retortions of this one Argument, I have endeavoured to ſhew you, how ill you have complied with your own advice, which was <hi>to take heed of urging Arguments that might be returned upon you.</hi> I ſhould now by a direct anſwer, ſhew that it preſſeth not us at all: but I have in paſſing done it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, in the end of the ſecond retortion of this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and thither I refer the Reader.</p>
                     <p n="80">80. Whereas therefore, you exhort them <hi>that will have aſſurance of true Scriptures, to fly to your Church for it:</hi> I deſire to know (if they ſhould follow your advice) how they ſhould be aſſured that your Church can give them any ſuch aſſurance; which hath been <hi>confeſſedly</hi> ſo negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, as to ſuffer many <hi>whole Books of Scripture</hi> to be ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly loſt. Again, in thoſe that remain, confeſſedly ſo negligent, as to ſuffer <hi>the Originals of theſe that remain to be corrupted.</hi> And laſtly, ſo careleſs of preſerving the integrity of the Copies of her Tranſlation, as to ſuffer <hi>infinite variety of Readings</hi> to come in to them, without keeping <hi>any one perfect Copy,</hi> which might have been as the Standard, and <hi>Polycletus</hi> his Canon to correct the reſt by. So that which was the true reading, and which the falſe, it was utterly undiſcernable, but only by comparing them with the Originals, which alſo ſhe pretends <hi>to be corrupted.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="84">84. Ad 17. §.] In this Diviſion you charge us <hi>with great uncertainty, concerning the true meaning of Scripture.</hi> Which hath been anſwered already, by ſaying, That if you ſpeak of plain places, (and in ſuch all things neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary are contained,) we are ſufficiently certain of the meaning of them, neither need they any Interpreter: If of obſcure and difficult places, we confeſs we are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain of the ſenſe of many of them. But then we ſay there is no neceſſity we ſhould be certain. For if Gods Will had been we ſhould have underſtood him more certainly, he would have ſpoken more plainly. And
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:57896:60"/>we ſay beſides, that as we are uncertain, ſo are You too; which he that doubts of, let him read your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentators upon the Bible, and obſerve their various and diſſonant Interpretations, and he ſhall in this point need no further ſatisfaction.</p>
                     <p n="85">85. <hi>Obj.</hi> But ſeeing <hi>there are contentions among us, we are taught by nature and Scripture, and experience</hi> (ſo you tell us out of M. <hi>Hooker</hi>) <hi>to ſeek for the ending of them, by ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting unto ſome Judicical ſentence, whereunto neither part may refuſe to ſtand.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is very true. Neither ſhould you need to perſuade us to ſeek ſuch a means of ending all our Controverſies, if we could tell where to find it. But this we know, that none is fit to pronounce, for all the World, a judicial definitive obliging Sentence in Controverſies of Religion, but only ſuch a Man, or ſuch a ſociety of Men, as is authorized thereto by God. And beſides we are able to demonſtrate, that it hath not been the pleaſure of God to give to any Man, or Society of Men any ſuch authority. And therefore though we wiſh heartily that all Controverſies were ended, as we do that all ſin were aboliſht, yet we have little hope of the one, or the other, till the World be ended. And in the mean while, think it beſt to content our ſelves with, and to perſuade others unto an <hi>Unity of Charity and mutual Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration;</hi> ſeeing God hath authorized no man to force all men to <hi>Unity of Opinion.</hi> Neither do we think it fit to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue thus, To us it ſeems convenient there ſhould be one Judge of all Controverſies for the whole World, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God has appointed one: But more modeſt and more reaſonable to collect thus, God hath appointed no ſuch Judge of Controverſies, therefore, though it ſeems to us convenient there ſhould be one, yet it is not ſo: Or though it were convenient for us to have one, yet it hath pleaſed God (for Reaſons beſt known to himſelf) not to allow us this convenience.</p>
                     <p n="87">87. Ad 18. §.] That the true Interpretation of the Scripture ought to be received from the Church, you need not prove, for it is very eaſily granted by them, who
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:57896:61"/>profeſs themſelves very ready to receive all Truths, much more the true ſenſe of Scripture, not only from the Church, but from any Society of men, nay from any man what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever.</p>
                     <p n="88">88. That the <hi>Churches Interpretation of Scripture is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways true,</hi> that is it which you would have ſaid: and that in ſome ſenſe may be alſo admitted. <hi>viz.</hi> If you ſpeak of that Church (which before you ſpeak of in the 14. §.) that is, of the Church of all Ages ſince the Apoſtles. Upon the Tradition of which Church, you there told us, <hi>We were to receive the Scripture, and to believe it to be the Word of God.</hi> For there you teach us, that <hi>our Faith of Scripture depends on a Principle which requires no other proof,</hi> And that, <hi>ſuch is Tradition, which from Hand to Hand, and Age to Age bring us up to the Times and Perſons of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles and our Saviour himſelf, cometh to be confirmed by all thoſe Miracles, and other Arguments whereby they convinced their Doctrine to be true.</hi> Wherefore the Ancient Fathers avouch that we muſt receive the Sacred Scripture upon the Tradition of this Church. The Tradition then of this Church you ſay muſt teach us what is Scripture: and we are willing to believe it. And now if you make it good unto us, that the ſame Tradition down from the Apoſtles, hath delivered from Age to Age, and from Hand to Hand, any Interpretation of any Scripture, we are ready to embrace that alſo. But now, if you will ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue thus: The Church in one ſenſe, tells us what is Scripture, and we believe, therefore if the Church ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in another ſenſe, tell us, this or that is the meaning of the Scripture, we are to believe that alſo; this is too tranſparent Sophiſtry, to take any but thoſe that are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be taken.</p>
                     <p n="89">89. If there be any Traditive Interpretation of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, produce it, and prove it to be ſo; and we em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace it. But the Tradition of all Ages is one thing; and the authority of the preſent Church, much more of the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> which is but a Part, and a corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Part of the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> is another. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore though we are ready to receive both Scripture and
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:57896:61"/>the ſenſe of Scripture upon the authority of <hi>Original Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,</hi> yet we receive neither the one, nor the other, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Authority of your Church.</p>

<pb n="114" facs="tcp:57896:62"/>Moſt evident likewiſe from the comparing of the ſtory of <hi>Jacob</hi> in <hi>Geneſis,</hi> with that which is cited out of it, in the <hi>Epiſtle to the Hebrews,</hi> according to the vulgar E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.

                     <p n="93">93. Thus you ſee what reaſon we have to believe your Antecedent, <hi>That your Church it is which muſt declare, what Books be true Scripture.</hi> Now for the conſequence, that certainly is as liable to exception as the Antecedent. For if it were true, that God had promiſed to aſſiſt you, for the delivering of true Scripture, would this oblige him, or would it follow from hence that He had obliged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, to teach you, not only ſufficiently, but <hi>effectually</hi> and <hi>irriſiſtably</hi> the true ſenſe of Scripture? God is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective in things neceſſary: neither will he leave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf without witneſs, nor the World without means of knowing his will and doing it. And therefore it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that by his Providence he ſhould preſerve the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from any undiſcernable corruption, in thoſe things which he would have known: otherwiſe it is apparent, it had not been his will, that theſe things ſhould be known, the only means of continuing the knowledg of them being periſhed. But now neither is God laviſh in ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluities, and therefore having given us means ſufficient for our direction, and power ſufficient to make uſe of theſe means, he will not conſtrain or neceſſitate us to make uſe of theſe means. For that were to croſs the end of our Creation, which was to be glorified by our free obedience: whereas neceſſity and freedom cannot ſtand together. That were to reverſe the Law which he hath preſcribed to himſelf in his dealing with men, and that is, <hi>to ſet Life and Death before him, and to leave him in the hands of his own Counſel.</hi> God gave the Wiſemen a Star to lead them to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but he did not neceſſitate them to follow the guidance of this Star: that was left to their liberty. God gave the Children of <hi>Iſrael a Fire to lead them by Night, and a Pillar of Cloud by Day,</hi> but he conſtrained no man to follow them: that was left to
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:57896:62"/>their liberty. So he gives the Church, the Scripture: which in thoſe things which are to be believed or done, are plain and eaſie to be followed, like the Wiſemens Star. Now that which he deſires of us on our part, is the Obedience of Faith, and love of the Truth, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to find the true ſenſe of it, and induſtry in ſearching it, and humility in following, and Conſtancy in profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it: all which if he ſhould work in us by an abſolute irreſiſtible neceſſity, he could no more require of us, as our duty, than he can of the Sun to ſhine, of the Sea to Ebb and Flow, and of all other Creatures to do thoſe things which by meer neceſſity they muſt do, and cannot chooſe. Beſides, what an impudence is it to pretend that <hi>your Church is infallibly directed concerning the true meaning of the Scripture,</hi> whereas there are Thouſands of places of Scripture, which you do not pretend certainly to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, and about the Interpretation whereof, your own Doctors differ among themſelves? If your Church be infallibly directed concerning the true meaning of Scripture, why do not your Doctors follow her infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble direction? And if they do, how comes ſuch diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence among them in their Interpretations?</p>
                     <p n="94">94. Again, why does your Church thus put her Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle under a Buſhel, and keep her Talent of interpreting Scripture infallibly, thus long wrapt up in Napkins? Why ſets ſhe not forth Infallible Commentaries or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions upon all the Bible? Is it becauſe this would not be profitable for Chriſtians, that Scripture ſhould be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted? Is it blaſphemous to ſay ſo. The Scripture it ſelf tells us, <hi>All Scripture is profitable.</hi> And the Scripture is not ſo much the Words as the Senſe. And if it be not profitable, why does ſhe imploy particular Doctors to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret Scriptures fallibly? unleſs we muſt think that fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Interpretations of Scripture are profitable, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Interpretations would not be ſo?</p>
                     <p n="95">95. If you ſay <hi>the Holy Ghoſt, which aſſiſts the Church in interpreting, will move the Church to interpret when he ſhall think fit, and that the Church will do it when the Holy Ghoſt ſhall move her to do it:</hi> I demand whether the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:57896:63"/>Ghoſts moving of the Church to ſuch works as theſe be reſiſtible by the Church, or irreſiſtible. If reſiſtible, then the Holy Ghoſt may move, and the Church may not be moved. As certainly the Holy Ghoſt doth always move to an Action, when he ſhews us plainly that it would be for the good of men, and Honour of God. As he that hath any ſenſe will acknowledge that an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible expoſition of Scripture could not but be, and there is no conceivable reaſon, why ſuch a work ſhould be put off a day, but only becauſe you are conſcious to your ſelves, you cannot do it, and therefore make excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. But if the moving of the Holy Ghoſt be irreſiſtible, and you are not yet ſo moved to go about this work; then I confeſs you are excuſed. But then I would know, whether thoſe <hi>Popes</hi> which ſo long deferred the calling of a Council for the Reformation of your Church, at length pretended to be effected by the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> whether they may excuſe themſelves, for that they were not moved by the Holy Ghoſt to do it? I would know likewiſe, as this motion is irreſiſtible when it comes, ſo whether it be ſo ſimply neceſſary to the moving of your Church to any ſuch publick Action, that it cannot poſſibly move without it? That is, whether the <hi>Pope</hi> now could not, if he would, ſeat himſelf <hi>in Cathedra,</hi> and fall to writing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions upon the Bible for the directions of Chriſtians to the true ſenſe of it? If you ſay he cannot, you will make your ſelf ridiculous. If he can, then I would know, whether he ſhould be infallibly directed in theſe expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or no? If he ſhould, then what need he to ſtay for irreſiſtible motion? Why does he not go about this noble work preſently? If he ſhould not, How ſhall we know that the calling of the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> was not upon his own voluntary motion, or upon humane im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity and ſuggeſtion, and not upon the motion of the Holy Ghoſt? And conſequently how ſhall we know whether he were aſſiſtant to it or no, ſeeing he aſſiſts none but what he himſelf moves to? And whether he did move the <hi>Pope</hi> to call this Council, is a ſecret thing, which we cannot poſſibly know, nor perhaps the <hi>Pope</hi> himſelf.</p>

                     <p n="96">96. If you ſay, your meaning is only, <hi>That the Church ſhall be infallibly guarded from giving any falſe ſenſe of any Scripture, and not infalliblyaſſiſted poſitively to give the true ſenſe of all Scripture:</hi> I put to you your own Queſtion, why ſhould we believe the Holy Ghoſt will ſtay there? Or, why may we not as well think he will ſtay at the firſt thing, that is, in teaching the Church what Books be true Scripture? For if the Holy Ghoſts aſſiſtance be promiſed to all things profitable, then will he be with them infallibly, not only to guard them from all Errors, but to guide them to all profitable truths, ſuch as the true ſenſes of all Scripture would be. Neither could he ſtay there, but defend them irreſiſtibly from all Vices; Nor there neither, but infuſe into them irreſiſtibly all Vertues: for all theſe things would be much for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of Chriſtians. If you ſay, he cannot do this with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out taking away their free-will in living; I ſay neither can he neceſſitate men to believe aright, without taking away their free-will in believing and in profeſſing their belief.</p>

Which you your ſelf have taught us to be the <hi>only Principle by which the Scripture is proved, and which it ſelf needs no proof;</hi> and to which you have referred this very ſaying of S. <hi>Auſtin, Ego vero Evangelio non crede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem niſi, &amp;c. p.</hi> 55. And in the next place which you cite out of his Book <hi>De Util. Cred. c.</hi> 14. he ſhews, that his <hi>motives to believe, were, Fame, Celebrity, Conſent, Antiquity.</hi> And ſeeing this Tradition, this Conſent, this Antiquity did as fully and powerfully move him not to believe <hi>Manichaeus,</hi> as to believe the Goſpel, (the Chriſtian Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition being as full againſt <hi>Manichaeus</hi> as it was for the Goſpel) therefore he did well to conclude upon theſe
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:57896:64"/>grounds, that he had as much reaſon to disbelieve <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nichaeus,</hi> as to believe the Goſpel. Now if you can truly ſay, that the ſame Fame, Celebrity, Conſent, Antiquity, that the ſame Univerſal and Original Tradition, lies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin,</hi> as did againſt <hi>Manichaeus,</hi> you may do well to apply the Argument againſt them; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it will be to little purpoſe to ſubſtitute their names inſtead of <hi>Manichaeus,</hi> unleſs you can ſhew the things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees to them as well as him.</p>

                     <p n="99">99. I anſwer, Firſt that it is a vain preſumption of yours that the <hi>Catholick Church is of your ſide.</hi> Secondly, that if S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſpeak here of that preſent Church, which moved him to believe the Goſpel, without conſideration of the Antiquity of it, and its both Perſonal and Doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſucceſſion from the Apoſtles; His Argument will be like a <hi>Buskin</hi> that will ſerve any leg. It will ſerve to keep an <hi>Arrian,</hi> or a <hi>Grecian</hi> from being a <hi>Roman Catholick,</hi> as well as a Catholick from being an <hi>Arrian,</hi> or a <hi>Grecian?</hi> In as much as the <hi>Arrians</hi> and <hi>Grecians,</hi> did pretend to the Title of Catholicks, and the Church, as much as the <hi>Papiſts</hi> now do. If then you ſhould have come to an Ancient <hi>Goth</hi> or <hi>Vandal,</hi> whom the <hi>Arrians</hi> converted to Chriſtianity, and ſhould have moved him to your Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; might he not ſay the very ſame words to you as S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> to the <hi>Manichaeans? I would not believe the Goſpel, unleſs the Authority of the Church did move me. Them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whom I obeyed, ſaying believe the Goſpel, why ſhould I not obey ſaying to me, do not believe the</hi> Homoouſians? <hi>Chooſe what thou pleaſeſt: If thou ſhalt ſay believe the</hi> Arrians, <hi>they warn me not to give any Credit to you.

                        <hi>I believed the Goſpel it ſelf.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer, Until you can ſhew that <hi>Proteſtants</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that Chriſt commanded any good thing, that is, That they believe the truth of Chriſtian Religion upon the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> this place muſt be wholly imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent to your purpoſe; which is to make <hi>Proteſtants</hi> believe your Church to be the infallible expounder of Scriptures and judge of Controverſies: nay rather is it not directly againſt your purpoſe? For why may not a member of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> who received his Baptiſm, Education and Faith from the Miniſtry of this Church, ſay juſt ſo to you as S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> here to the <hi>Manichees?</hi> Why ſhould I not moſt diligently inquire, what Chriſt commanded, of them (the Church of <hi>England</hi>) before all others, by whoſe authority I was moved to believe, that Chriſt command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded any good thing, Can you, <hi>F.</hi> or <hi>K.</hi> or whoſoever you are, better declare to me what he ſaid, whom I would not have thought to have been or to be, if the belief thereof had been recommended by you to me? This therefore (that <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> did thoſe miracles, and taught that Doctrine which is contained evidently in the undoubted Books of the <hi>New Teſtament</hi>) I believed by Fame, ſtrengthened with Celebrity and Conſent, (even of thoſe which in other things are at infinite variance one with another,) and laſtly by Antiquity (which gives an Univerſal and a conſtant atteſtation to them) But
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:57896:65"/>every one may ſee that you, ſo few (in compariſon of all thoſe upon whoſe conſent we ground our belief of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,) ſo turbulent, (that you damn all to the Fire, and to Hell, that any way differ from you; that you profeſs it is lawful for you, to uſe violence and power whenſoever you can have it, for the planting of your own Doctrine, and the extirpation of the contrary;) laſtly ſo new in many of your Doctrines, (as in the lawfulneſs, and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of debarring the Laity the Sacramental Cup; the lawfulneſs and expedience of your Latine Service, Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation, Indulgences, Purgatory, the <hi>Popes</hi> infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, his Authority over Kings, <hi>&amp;c</hi>) ſo new I ſay, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of the undoubted Books of Scripture, which evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently containeth, or rather is our Religion, and the ſole, and adequate object of our Faith: I ſay every one may ſee that you, ſo few, ſo turbulent, ſo new, can produce no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing deſerving authority (with wiſe and conſiderate men) What madneſs is this? Believe them the conſent of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians which are now, and have been ever ſince Chriſt in the World, that we ought to believe Chriſt; but learn of us what Chriſt ſaid, which contradict and damn all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts of Chriſtendom. Why I beſeech you? Surely if they were not at all, and could not teach me any thing, I would more eaſily perſuade my ſelf, that I were not to believe in Chriſt, than that I ſhould learn any thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning him, from any other, than them by whom I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved him: at leaſt, than that I ſhould learn what his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion was from you, who have wronged ſo exceedingly his Miracles and his Doctrine, by forging ſo evidently ſo many falſe Miracles for the Confirmation of your new Doctrine; which might give us juſt occaſion, had we no other aſſurance of them but your Authority, to ſuſpect the true ones. Who with forging ſo many falſe Stories, and falſe Authors, have taken a fair way to make the Faith of all Stories queſtionable; if we had no other ground for our belief of them but your Authority: who have brought in Doctrines plainly and directly contrary to that which you confeſs to be the Word of Chriſt, and which, for the moſt part, make either for the honour
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:57896:65"/>or profit of the Teachers of them: which (if there were no difference between the Chriſtian and the <hi>Roman</hi> Church) would be very apt to make ſuſpicious men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that Chriſtian Religion was a humane invention, taught by ſome cunning Impoſtors, only to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves rich and powerful; who make a profeſſion of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting all ſorts of Authors: a ready courſe to make it juſtly queſtionable whether any remain uncorrupted. For if you take this Authority upon you, upon the ſix Ages laſt paſt; how ſhall we know, that the Church of that time, did not Uſurp the ſame Authority upon the Authors of the ſix laſt Ages before them, and ſo upwards until we come to Chriſt himſelf? Whoſe queſtioned Doctrines, none of them came from the Fountain of Apoſtolick Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, but have inſinuated themſelves into the Streams, by little and little, ſome in one Age, and ſome in another, ſome more Anciently, ſome more lately, and ſome yet are Embrio's, yet hatching, and in the Shell; as the <hi>Popes</hi> Infallibility, the Bleſſed Virgins immaculate conception, the <hi>Popes</hi> power over the Temporalities of Kings, the Doctrine of Predetermination, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all which yet are, or in time may be impoſed upon Chriſtians under the Title of <hi>Original and Apoſtolick Tradition;</hi> and that with that neceſſity, that they are told, they were as good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve nothing at all, as not believe theſe things to have come from the Apoſtles, which they know to have been brought in but yeſterday: which whether it be not a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and likely way to make men conclude thus with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves— I am told, that I were as good believe nothing at all, as believe ſome points which the Church teaches me, and not others: and ſome things which ſhe teaches to be Ancient and Certain, I plainly ſee to be New and Falſe, therefore I will believe nothing at all. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I ſay the foreſaid grounds be not a ready and likely way to make men conclude thus, and whether this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion be not too often made in <hi>Italy,</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> and in <hi>England</hi> too, I leave it to the judgment of thoſe that have Wiſdom and Experience. Seeing therefore the <hi>Roman Church</hi> is ſo far from being a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:57896:66"/>Foundation for our belief in Chriſt, that it is in ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry regards a dangerous temptation againſt it; why ſhould I not much rather conclude, Seeing we receive not the knowledg of Chriſt and Scriptures from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> neither from her muſt we take his Doctrine, or the Interpretation of Scripture?</p>
                     <p n="102">102. Ad §. 19. In this number, this Argument is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. <hi>The Judge of Controverſies ought to be intelligible to learned and unlearned; The Scripture is not ſo, and the Church is ſo; Therefore the Church is the Judge, and not the Scripture.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="103">103. To this I anſwer: As to be underſtandible is a condition requiſite to a Judge, ſo is not that alone ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to make a Judge; otherwiſe you might make your ſelf Judge of Controverſies, by arguing; The Scripture is not intelligible by all, but I am, therefore I am Judge of Controverſies. If you ſay your intent was to conclude againſt the Scripture, and not for the Church: I demand why then, but to delude the ſimple with Sopiſtry, did you ſay in the cloſe of this §. <hi>Such is the Church, and the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is not ſuch?</hi> but that you would leave it to them to infer in the end, (which indeed was more than you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook in the beginning) <hi>Therefore the Church is Judge and the Scripture not.</hi> I ſay Secondly; that you ſtill run upon a falſe ſuppoſition: that God hath appointed ſome Judge of all Controverſies that may happen among Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, about the ſenſe of obſcure Texts of Scripture: whereas he has left every one to his liberty herein, in thoſe words of S. <hi>Paul, Quiſque abundet in ſenſu ſuo,</hi> &amp;c. I ſay Thirdly. Whereas ſome <hi>Proteſtants</hi> make the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Judge of Controverſies, that they have the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Fathers to warrant their manner of ſpeaking: as of

                     <p n="104">104. But ſpeaking truly and properly the Scripture is not a Judge nor cannot be, but only, a <hi>ſufficient Rule,</hi> for thoſe to judge by, that believe it to be the word of God (as the Church of <hi>England</hi> and the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> both do,) what they are to believe, and what they are not to believe. I ſay ſufficiently perfect, and ſufficiently intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in things neceſſary, to all that have underſtanding,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:57896:66"/>whether they be learned or unlearned. And my reaſon hereof is convincing and demonſtrative; becauſe nothing is neceſſary to be believed, but what is plainly revealed. For to ſay, that when a place of Scripture, by reaſon of ambiguous terms, lies indifferent between divers ſenſes, whereof one is true, and the other is falſe, that God ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liges men under pain of damnation, not to miſtake through error and humane frailty, is to make God a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, and to ſay that he requires us certainly to attain that end, for the attaining whereof we have no certain means; which is to ſay, that, like <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> he gives no ſtraw, and requires brick; that he reaps where he ſows not; that he gathers where he ſtrews not, that he will not be pleaſed with our utmoſt endeavors to pleaſe him, without full and exact and never failing performance; that his will is we ſhould do what he knows we cannot do; that he will not accept of us according to that which we have, but requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth of us what we have not. Which whether it can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt with his goodneſs, with his wiſdom, and with his word, I leave it to honeſt men to judge. If I ſhould ſend a Servant to <hi>Paris,</hi> or <hi>Rome,</hi> or <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and he uſing his utmoſt diligence not to miſtake his way, yet notwithſtanding, meeting often with ſuch places where the road is divided into ſeveral ways, whereof every one is as likely to be true, and as likely to be falſe as any other, ſhould at length miſtake and go out of the way; would not any man ſay that I were an impotent, fooliſh and unjuſt Maſter, if I ſhould be offended with him for doing ſo? And ſhall we not tremble to impute that to God, which we would take in foul ſcorn, if it were imputed to our ſelves? Certainly, I for my part fear I ſhould not love God if I ſhould think ſo ſtrangely of him.</p>
                     <p n="105">105. Again, When you ſay, <hi>that unlearned, and ignorant men cannot underſtand Scripture,</hi> I would deſire you to come out of the Clouds, and tell us what you mean: Whether, that they cannot underſtand all Scripture, or that they cannot underſtand any Scripture, or that they cannot underſtand ſo much as is ſufficient for their direction to Heaven. If the firſt; I believe the Learned are in the
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:57896:67"/>ſame Caſe. If the Second; every mans experience will confute you: for who is there that is not capable of a ſufficient underſtanding of the Story, the Precepts, the Promiſes, and the Threats of the Goſpel? If the Third; that they may underſtand ſomething, but not enough for their Salvations; I ask you, firſt. Why then doth Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſay to <hi>Timothy, The Scriptures are able to make him wiſe unto Salvation?</hi> Why does Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſay, <hi>Ea quae manifeſtè poſita ſunt in ſacris Scripturis, omnia continent quae pertinent ad Fidem Moreſque vivendi?</hi> Why does every one of the four <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> Intitle their Book <hi>The Goſpel,</hi> if any neceſſary and eſſential part of the Goſpel were left out of it? Can we imagine, that either they omitted ſomething neceſſary, out of ignorance not knowing it to be neceſſary? Or knowing it to be ſo, maliciouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed it? Or out of negligence, did the work they had undertaken by halfes? If none of theſe things can with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Blaſphemy be imputed to them, conſidering they were aſſiſted by the Holy Ghoſt in this work, then cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly it moſt evidently follows, that every one of them writ the whole Goſpel of Chriſt; I mean all the eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and neceſſary parts of it. So that if we had no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Book of Scripture, but one of them alone, we ſhould not want any thing neceſſary to Salvation. And what one of them has more than another, it is only profitable, and not neceſſary.

For Firſt; How ſhall an unlearned man whom you have ſuppoſed now ignorant of Scripture, how ſhall he know which of all the Societies of Chriſtians is indeed the Church? You will ſay perhaps, <hi>he muſt examine them by the notes of the Church, which are perpetual Viſibility, Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, Conformity with the ancient Church,</hi> &amp;c. But how ſhall he know, firſt, that theſe are the notes of the Church, unleſs by Scripture, which you ſay he underſtands not? You may ſay perhaps, he may be told ſo. But ſeeing men may deceive, and be deceived, and their words are no demonſtrations, how ſhall he be aſſured that what they ſay is true? So that at the firſt he meets with an impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable difficulty, and cannot know the Church but by ſuch notes, which whether they be the notes of the Church he cannot poſſibly know. But let us ſuppoſe this <hi>Iſthmus</hi> digged through, and that he is aſſured theſe are the notes of the true Church: How can he poſſibly be a competent Judge, which Society of Chriſtians hath Title to theſe notes, and which hath not? Seeing this Trial of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity requires a great ſufficiency of knowledge of the monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Chriſtian Antiquity, which no unlearned can have, becauſe he that hath it cannot be unlearned. As for example, how ſhall he poſſibly be able to know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath had a perpetual Succeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Viſible Profeſſors, which held always the ſame Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine which they now hold, without holding any thing to the contrary; unleſs he hath firſt examined, what was the Doctrine of the Church in the firſt Age, what in the ſecond, and ſo forth? And whether this be not a more difficult work, than to ſtay at the firſt Age, and to examine the Church by the conformity of her Doctrine, with the Doctrine of the firſt Age, every man of ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry underſtanding may Judge.</p>

                     <p>Let us imagine him advanced a ſtep farther, and to know which is the Church: how ſhall he know what that Church hath Decreed, ſeeing the Church hath not been ſo careful in keeping of her Decrees, but that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny are loſt, and many corrupted? Beſides, when even the Learned among you are not agreed concerning di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers things, whether they be <hi>De Fide</hi> or not; how ſhall the unlearned do? Then for the ſenſe of the Decrees, how can he be more capable of the underſtanding of them, then of plain Texts of Scripture, which you will not ſuffer him to underſtand? Eſpecially, ſeeing the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of divers <hi>Popes</hi> and Councils are conceived ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurely, that the Learned cannot agree about the ſenſe of them. And then they are written all in ſuch Langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges which the ignorant underſtand not, and therefore muſt of neceſſity rely herein upon the uncertain and fallible authority of ſome particular men, who inform them that there is ſuch a Decree. And if the Decrees were Tranſlated into Vulgar Languages, why the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlators ſhould not be as fallible as you ſay the Tranſlators of Scripture are, who can poſſibly imagine?</p>
                     <p n="109">109. Laſtly, how ſhall an unlearned man, or indeed any man, be aſſured of the certainty of that Decree, the certainty whereof depends upon ſuppoſitions which are impoſſible to be known whether they be true or no? For it is not the Decree of a Council, unleſs it be confirmed by a true <hi>Pope.</hi> Now the <hi>Pope</hi> cannot be a true <hi>Pope</hi> if he came in by Simony: which whether he did or no, who can anſwer me? He cannot be a true <hi>Pope</hi> unleſs he were Baptized, and Baptized he was not, unleſs the Miniſter had due Intention. So likewiſe he cannot be a true <hi>Pope,</hi> unleſs he were rightly ordained Prieſt, and that again de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon the Ordainers ſecret Intention, and alſo upon his having the Epiſcopal Character. All which things, as I have formerly proved, depend upon ſo many uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſuppoſitions, that no humane judgment can poſſibly be reſolved in them. I conclude therefore, that not the learnedſt man amongſt you all, no not the <hi>Pope</hi> himſelf, can, according to the grounds you go upon, have any

For is there not a manifeſt difference between ſaying, <hi>the Spirit of God tells me that this is the meaning of ſuch a Text</hi> (which no man can poſſibly know to be true, it being a ſecret thing) and between ſaying, <hi>theſe and theſe Reaſons I have to ſhew, that this or that is true Doctrine, or that this or that is the meaning of ſuch a Scripture?</hi> Reaſon being a publick and certain thing and expoſed to all mens Trial and Examination.

Or would you have all men believe all your Doctrine upon the Churches Infallibility, and the Churches Infallibility they know not why?</p>

And to that purpoſe you your ſelves give a great many Notes, which you pretend firſt to be Certain Notes of the Church, and then to be peculiar to your Church, and agreeable to none elſe;
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:57896:69"/>but you do not ſo much as pretend, that either of thoſe pretences is evident of it ſelf, and therefore you go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to prove them both by reaſons; and thoſe reaſons I hope every particular man is to judge of, whether they do indeed conclude and convince that which they are alledged for: that is, that theſe marks are indeed cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Notes of the Church, and then that your Church hath them, and no other.</p>
                     <p n="113">113. One of theſe Notes, indeed the only Note of a true and uncorrupted Church, is conformity with Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity; I mean the moſt Ancient Church of all, that is the Primitive and Apoſtolick. Now how is it poſſible any man ſhould examine your Church by this Note, but he muſt by his own particular judgment, find out what was the Doctrine of the Primitive Church, and what is the Doctrine of the preſent Church, and be able to anſwer all theſe Arguments which are brought to prove repugnance between them? otherwiſe he ſhall but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to make uſe of this Note for the finding the true Church, but indeed make no uſe of it, but receive the Church at a venture, as the moſt of you do; not one in a Hundred being able to give any tolerable reaſon for it. So that inſtead of reducing Men to particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar reaſon, you reduce them to none at all, but to chance and paſſion, and prejudice and ſuch other ways, which if they lead one to the Truth, they lead Hundreds, nay Thouſands to Falſhood. But it is a pretty thing to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, how theſe men can blow Hot and Cold out of the ſame mouth to ſerve ſeveral purpoſes. Is there hope of gaining a Proſelyte? Then they will tell you, God hath given every every man Reaſon to follow; and if the Blind lead the Blind, both ſhall fall into the Ditch. That it is no good reaſon for a mans Religion, that he was Born and brought up in it: For then a <hi>Turk</hi> ſhould have as much reaſon to be a <hi>Turk,</hi> as a Chriſtian to be a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian. That every man hath a judgment of Diſcretion; which if they will make uſe of, they ſhall eaſily find: that the true Church hath always ſuch and ſuch marks, and that their Church has them, and no other but theirs. But
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:57896:69"/>then if any of theirs be perſuaded to a ſincere and ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Trial of their Church, even by their own Notes of it, and to try whether they be indeed ſo conformable to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity as they pretend, then their Note is changed: you muſt not uſe your own reaſon nor your judgment, but refer all to the Church, and believe her to be conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to Antiquity, though they have no reaſon for it, nay though they have evident reaſon to the contrary. For my part I am certain that God hath given us our Reaſon to diſcern between Truth and Falſhood, and he that makes not this uſe of it, but believes things he knows not why, I ſay it is by chance that he believes the Truth, and not by choice: and that I cannot but fear, that God will not accept of this <hi>Sacrifice of Fools.</hi>

But then as for the Authority which you would have them follow, you will let them ſee reaſon why they ſhould follow it. And is not this to go a little about? to leave reaſon for a ſhort turn, and then to come to it again, and to do that which you condemn in others? It being indeed a plain impoſſibility for any man to ſubmit his reaſon but to reaſon: for he that does it to Authority, muſt of neceſſity think himſelf to have greater reaſon to believe that Authority. Therefore the confeſſion cited by <hi>Brerely,</hi> you need not think to have been extorted from <hi>Luther</hi> and the reſt.

Oh but you ſay, <hi>They receive it not becauſe they think it agreeable to Scripture, but becauſe the Church tells them ſo.</hi> But then I hope they believe the Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their own reaſon tells them they are to do ſo. So that the difference between a <hi>Papiſt</hi> and a <hi>Proteſtant</hi> is this, not that the one judges and the other does not judge, but that the one judges his guide to be infallible, the other his way to be manifeſt. <hi>This ſame pernitious Doctrine is taught by</hi> Brentius, Zanchius, Cartwright, <hi>and others.</hi> It is ſo in very deed: But it is taught alſo by ſome others, whom you little think of.

Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, not to be infinite, it is taught by M. <hi>Knot</hi> himſelf, not in one Page only, or Chapter of his <hi>Book,</hi> but all his Book over; the very writing and publiſhing whereof, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth this for certain, that the Readers are to be Judges, whether his Reaſons which he brings, be ſtrong and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing; of which ſort we have hitherto met with none: or elſe captious, or impertinences, as indifferent men ſhall (as I ſuppoſe) have cauſe to judge them.</p>

But what has this to do with Common-wealths, where men are bound only to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal obedience, unto the Laws and Judgments of Courts, but not to an internal approbation of them, no nor to conceal their Judgment of them, if they diſapprove them? As if I conceived I had reaſon to miſlike the Law of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing ſimple Theft with Death, as Sir <hi>Thomas Moore</hi> did, I might profeſs lawfully my judgment, and repreſent my reaſons to the King or Common-wealth in a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as Sir <hi>Thomas Moore</hi> did, without committing any fault, or fearing any puniſhment.</p>

And do you not this by the direction of your private reaſon? If you do, why do you condemn it in others? If you do not, I pray you tell me what direction you follow? or whether you
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:57896:71"/>follow none at all? If none at all, this is like drawing Lots, or throwing the Dice for the choice of a Religion. If any other: I beſeech you tell me what it is. Perhaps you will ſay, <hi>the Churches Authority;</hi> and that will be to dance finely in a round, thus, To believe the Churches In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Authority, becauſe the Scriptures avouch it; and to believe that Scriptures ſay and mean ſo, becauſe they are ſo expounded by the Church. Is not this for a Father to beget his Son, and the Son to beget his Father? For a foundation to ſupport the houſe, and the houſe to ſupport the foundation? Would not <hi>Campian</hi> have cryed out at it, <hi>Ecce quos gyros, quos Maeandros?</hi> And to what end was this going about, when you might as well at firſt have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded the Church infallible becauſe ſhe ſays ſo; as thus to put in Scripture for a meer ſtale, and to ſay, the Church is infallible becauſe the Scripture ſays ſo, and the Scripture means ſo becauſe the Church ſays ſo, which is infallible? Is it not moſt evident therefore to every intelligent man, that you are enforced of neceſſity to do that your ſelf, which ſo Tragically you declaim againſt in others? The Church, you ſay, is Infallible; I am very doubtful of it: How ſhall I know it? The Scripture you ſay affirms it, as in the 59. of <hi>Eſau, My ſpirit that is in thee, &amp;c.</hi> Well I confeſs I find there theſe words: but I am ſtill doubtful, whether they be ſpoken of the Church of Chriſt: and if they be, whether they mean as you pretend. You ſay, the Church ſays ſo, which is infallible. Yea but that is the Queſtion, and therefore not to be begged but proved. Neither is it ſo evident as to need no proof: otherwiſe why brought you this Text to prove it? Nor is it of ſuch a ſtrange quality, above all other Propoſitions, as to be able to prove it ſelf. What then remains but that you ſay, Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons drawn out of the Circumſtances of the Text, will evince that this is the ſenſe of it. Perhaps they will. But Reaſons cannot convince me, unleſs I judge of them by my Reaſon; and for every man or woman to relie on that, in the choice of their Religion, and in the interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Scripture, you ſay is a horrible abſurdity; and therefore muſt neither make uſe of your own in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, nor deſire me to make uſe of it.</p>

But that it has I hope you would not have me take upon your word: for that were to build my ſelf upon the Church, and the Church upon You. Let then the Tradition appear; for a ſecret Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is ſomewhat like a ſilent Thunder. You will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps produce, for the confirmation of it, ſome ſayings of ſome Fathers, who in every Age taught this Doctrine; (as <hi>Gualterius</hi> in his Chronology undertakes to do, but with ſo ill ſucceſs, that I heard an able Man of your Religion profeſs, that <hi>in the firſt three Centuries, there was not one Authority pertinent:</hi>) but how will you warrant that none of them teach the contrary? Again, how ſhall I be aſſured that the places have indeed this ſenſe in them? Seeing there is not one Father for 500 years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Chriſt, that does ſay in plain terms, <hi>The Church of</hi> Rome <hi>is Infallible.</hi> What, ſhall we believe your Church that this is their meaning? But this will be again to go into the Circle, which made us giddy before; To prove the Church Infallible becauſe Tradition ſays ſo, Tradition to ſay ſo, becauſe the Fathers ſay ſo, The Fathers to ſay ſo, becauſe the Church ſays ſo, which is Infallible.

Or perhaps this was not a caſe of moment. D. <hi>Potter</hi> indeed might ſay very well, not that the high Prieſt was infallible, (for certainly he was not) but that his determination was to be of neceſſity obeyed, though for the juſtice of it there was no neceſſity that it ſhould be believed. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, it is one thing to ſay, that the living judge in the Jewiſh Church, had an infallible direction: another, that he was neceſſitated to follow this direction. This is the priviledge which you challenge. But it is that, not this, which the Doctor attributes to the <hi>Jews.</hi> As a man may truly ſay, the Wiſe men had an infallible direction to Chriſt, without ſaying or thinking that they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to follow it, and could not do otherwiſe.</p>
                     <p n="125">125. <hi>But either the Church retains ſtill her infallibility, or it was deveſted of it upon the receiving of Holy Scripture; which is abſurd.</hi> An Argument methinks like this, Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you have Horns or you have loſt them: but you never loſt them, therefore you have them ſtill. If you ſay you never had Horns; ſo ſay I, for ought appears by your reaſons, the Church never had infallibility.</p>
                     <p n="126">126. <hi>But ſome Scriptures were received in ſome places and not in others: therefore if Scriptures were the Judge of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies, ſome Churches had one Judge and ſome another.</hi> And what great inconvenience is there in that, that one part of <hi>England</hi> ſhould have one Judge, and another another? eſpecially ſeeing the Books of Scripture which were received by thoſe that received feweſt, had as much of the Doctrine of Chriſtianity in them, as they all had which were received by any; all the neceſſary parts of the Goſpel being contained in every one of the four Goſpels, as I have proved: So that they which had all the Books of the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> had nothing ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: For it was not ſuperfluous but profitable, that the
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:57896:73"/>ſame thing ſhould be ſaid divers times, and be teſtified by divers witneſſes: And they that had but one of the four Goſpels wanted nothing neceſſary: and therefore it is vainly inferred by you, that <hi>with Months and Years, as new Canonical Scriptures grew to be publiſhed, the Church altered her rule of Faith and judge of Controverſies.</hi>

                     <p n="127">127. <hi>Hereſies,</hi> you ſay, <hi>would ariſe after the Apoſtles time and after the writing of Scriptures: Theſe cannot be diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, condemned and avoided, unleſs the Church be Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; Therefore there muſt be a Church infallible.</hi> But I pray tell me, Why cannot <hi>Hereſies</hi> be ſufficiently diſcovered, condemned, &amp; avoided, by them which believe Scripture to be the rule of Faith? If Scripture be ſufficient to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form us what is the Faith, it muſt of neceſſity be alſo ſufficient to teach us what is <hi>Hereſie:</hi> ſeeing <hi>Hereſie</hi> is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a manifeſt deviation from, and an oppoſition to the Faith. That which is ſtraight will plainly teach us what is crooked; and one contrary cannot but mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt the other. If any one ſhould deny, that there is a God: That this God is omnipotent, omniſcient, good, juſt, true, merciful, a rewarder of them that ſeek him, a puniſher of them that obſtinately offend him; that Jeſus Chriſt is the Son of God, and the Saviour of the World: that it is he by obedience to whom men muſt look to be ſaved: If any man ſhould deny either his Birth, or Paſſion, or Reſurrection, or Aſcenſion, or ſitting at the right Hand of God: his having all Power given him in Heaven and Earth: That it is he whom God hath appointed to be Judge of the Quick and the Dead: that all men ſhall Riſe again at the laſt Day: That they which believe and repent ſhall be ſaved: That they which do not believe or repent ſhall be damned: If a man ſhould hold, that either the keeping of the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Law is neceſſary to Salvation: or that good works are not neceſſary to Salvation: In a word, if any man ſhould obſtinatly contradict the truth of any thing plainly deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in Scripture, who does not ſee, that every one which believes the Scripture, hath a ſufficient means to diſcover, and condemn, and avoid that <hi>Hereſie,</hi> without
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:57896:74"/>any need of an infallible guide? If you ſay, that <hi>the obſcure places of Scripture contain matters of Faith:</hi> I anſwer, that it is a matter of Faith to believe that the ſenſe of them, whatſoever it is, which was intended by God is true; for he that does not do ſo calls Gods Truth into queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But to believe this or that to be the true ſenſe of them, or, to believe the true ſenſe of them, and to avoid the falſe, is not neceſſary either to Faith or Salvation. For if God would have had his meaning in theſe places certainly known, how could it ſtand with his wiſdom, to be ſo wanting to his own will and end, as to ſpeak obſcurely? or how can it conſiſt with his Juſtice, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of men to know certainly the meaning of thoſe words, which he himſelf hath not revealed? Suppoſe there were an abſolute Monarch, that in his own abſenſe from one of his Kingdoms, had written Laws for the Government of it, ſome very plainly, and ſome very ambiguouſly, and obſcurely, and his Suctjects ſhould keep thoſe that were plainly written with all exactneſs, and for thoſe that were obſcure, uſe their beſt diligence to find his meaning in them, and obey them according to the ſenſe of them which they conceived? ſhould this King either with juſtice or wiſdom be offended with theſe Subjects, if by reaſon of the obſcurity of them, they miſtook the ſenſe of them, and fail of performance, by reaſon of their Error?</p>

But, <hi>It is more uſeful &amp; fit,</hi> you ſay, <hi>for the decid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Controverſies, to have beſides an infallible Rule to go by, a living infallible Judge to determine them: &amp; from hence</hi> you <hi>conclude, that certainly there is ſuch a Judge.</hi> But why then may not another ſay, that it is yet more uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for many excellent purpoſes, that all the Patriarchs ſhould be infallible, than that the <hi>Pope</hi> only ſhould? Another, that it would be yet more uſeful, that all the Archbiſhops of every Province ſhould be ſo, than that the Patriarchs only ſhould be ſo. Another, that it would be yet more uſeful, if all the Biſhops of every Dioceſs were ſo. Another, that it would be yet more available, that all the Parſons of every Pariſh ſhould be ſo. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:57896:74"/>that it would be yet more excellent, if all the Fathers of Families were ſo. And laſtly, another, that it were much more to be deſired that every Man and every Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man were ſo: juſt as much as the prevention of Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies, is better than the deciſion of them, and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of Hereſies better than the condemnation of them; and upon this ground conclude, by your own ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry conſequence, That not only a general Council, nor only the Pope, but all the Patriarchs, Archbiſhops, Biſhops, Paſtors, Fathers, nay all the men in the World are infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. If you ſay now, as I am ſure you will, that this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion is moſt groſs, and abſurd againſt ſenſe and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, then muſt alſo the ground be falſe, from which it evidently and undeniably follows, <hi>viz.</hi> that, That courſe of dealing with men ſeems always more fit to Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, which ſeems moſt fit to humane reaſon.</p>

                     <p n="130">130. It were in all reaſon very uſeful and requiſite, that the Pope ſhould, by the aſſiſtance of Gods Spirit, be freed from the vices and paſſions of men, leſt otherwiſe, the Authority given him for the good of the Church, he might imploy (as divers Popes you well know have done) to the diſturbance, and oppreſſion and miſchief of it. And will you conclude from hence, That Popes are not ſubject to the ſins and paſſions of other men? That there never have been ambitious, covetous, luſtful, tyrannous Popes.</p>
                     <p n="131">131. Who ſees not that for mens direction it were much more beneficial for the Church, that Infallibility ſhould
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:57896:75"/>be ſetled in the Popes Perſon, than in a general Council: That ſo the means of deciding Controverſies might be ſpeedy, eaſie and perpetual, whereas that of general Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils is not ſo. And will you hence infer, that not the Church Repreſentative, but the Pope is indeed the infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Judge of Controverſies? certainly if you ſhould, the <hi>Sorbon</hi> Doctors would not think this a good concluſion.</p>
                     <p n="132">132. It had been very commodious (one would think) that, ſeeing either Gods pleaſure was the Scripture ſhould be tranſlated, or elſe in his Providence he knew it would be ſo, that he had appointed ſome men for this buſineſs, and by his Spirit aſſiſted them in it, that ſo we might have Tranſlations as Authentical as the Original: yet you ſee God did not think fit to do ſo.</p>
                     <p n="133">133. It had been very commodious (one would think) that the Scripture ſhould have been, at leaſt for all things neceſſary, a Rule, plain and perfect: And yet you ſay, it is both imperfect and obſcure, even in things neceſſary.</p>

                     <p n="135">135. Who can conceive, but that an Apoſtolick Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of all the difficult places of Scripture, would have been ſtrangely beneficial to the Church, eſpecially there being ſuch danger in miſtaking the ſenſe of them, as is by you pretended, and God in his providence foreſeeing that the greateſt part of Chriſtians, would not accept of the Pope for the Judge of Controverſies?

<pb n="141" facs="tcp:57896:75"/>of the Church, and they either alone, or with their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents, the Guides of Faith, and the Judges of Controverſies that ſhall ariſe amongſt Chriſtians?</hi> This, if you will deal ingenuouſly, you cannot but acknowledge; for then all true Chriſtians would have ſubmitted to him, as willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as to Chriſt himſelf, neither needed you and your fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, have troubled your ſelf to invent ſo many Sophiſms for the proof of it. There would have been no more doubt of it among Chriſtians, than there is of the Nativi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Paſſion, Reſurrection or Aſcenſion of Chriſt. You were beſt now rub your forehead hard, and conclude upon us, that becauſe this would have been ſo uſeful to have been done, therefore it is done. Or if you be (as I know you are) too ingenuous to ſay ſo, then muſt you acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that the ground of your Argument, which is the very ground of all theſe abſurdities, is moſt abſurd; and that it is our duty to be humbly thankful for thoſe ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, nay abundant means of Salvation, which God hath of his own goodneſs granted us: and not conclude, he hath done that which he hath not done, becauſe forſooth, in our vain judgments it ſeems convenient he ſhould have done ſo.</p>
                     <p n="137">137. But you demand <hi>what repugnance there is betwixt infallibility in the Church, and exiſtence of Scripture, that the production of the one muſt be the deſtruction of the other?</hi> Out of which words I can frame no other argument for you than this. <hi>There is no Repugnance between the Scriptures ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence, and the Churches infallibility, therefore the Church is infallible.</hi> Which conſequence will then be good, when you can ſhew, that nothing can be untrue, but that only which is impoſſible; that whatſoever may be done, that alſo is done. Which, if it were true, would conclude both you and me to be infallible, as well as either your Church, or Pope: in as much as there is no more repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance between the Scriptures exiſtence and our infallibility, than there is between theirs.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> This Argument put in form runs thus. No Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture affirms that by the entring thereof, infallibility went out of the Church: Therefore there is an infallible Church, and therefore the Scripture alone is not Judge, that is, the Rule to judge by. But as no Scripture affirms that by the entring of it, Infallibility went out of the Church, ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do we, neither have we any need to do ſo. But we ſay, that it continued in the Church even together with the Scriptures, ſo long as Chriſt and his Apoſtles were living, and then departed: God in his providence having provided a plain and infallible Rule, to ſupply the defect of living and infallible Guides.</p>
                     <p n="141">141. <hi>But the Jewiſh Church retained Infallibility in her ſelf; and therefore it is unjuſt to deprive the Church of Chriſt of it.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> That the Jews had ſometimes an infallible mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous direction from God, in ſome caſes of moment, he doth affirm and had good warrant: but that the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue was abſolutely Infallible, he no where affirms, and therefore it is unjuſtly and unworthily done of you to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trude it upon him. And indeed how can the Infallibility of the Synagogue be conceived, but only by ſetling it in the High Prieſt, and the company adhering and ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate unto him? And whether the High Prieſt was Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible, when he believed not Chriſt to be the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> but condemned and excommunicated them that ſo profeſſed, and cauſed him to be crucified for ſaying ſo, I leave it to Chriſtians to judge. But then ſuppoſe God had been ſo pleaſed to do as he did not, to appoint the Synagouge an infallible guide: Could you by your rules of Logick con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain him, to appoint ſuch a one to Chriſtians alſo, or ſay unto him, that, in wiſdom he could not do otherwiſe? Vain man that will be thus always tying God to your ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations! It is well for us that he leaves us not without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections to him, but if he will do this ſometime by living Guides, ſometime by written Rules, what is that to you? may not he do what he will with his own?</p>
                     <p n="144">144. <hi>Ad</hi> §. 24. Neither is this Diſcourſe (if you mean your Concluſion, that <hi>Your Church is the infallible Judge
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:57896:76"/>in Controverſies</hi>) confirmed by <hi>Irenaeus</hi> at all (<hi>Iren.</hi> l. 3. c. 3.) For neither has <hi>Irenaeus</hi> one ſyllable to this purpoſe, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can it be deduced out of what he ſays, with any colour of conſequence. For firſt in ſaying, <hi>What if the Apoſtles had not left Scripture, ought we not to have followed the Order of Tradition?</hi> And in ſaying, <hi>That to this Order many Nations yield aſſent, who believe in Chriſt, having Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation written in their hearts, by the Spirit of God, without Letters or Ink, and diligently keeping ancient Tradition:</hi> Doth he not plainly ſhew, that the Tradition he ſpeaks of, is nothing elſe, but the very ſame that is written: nothing but to believe in Chriſt? To which, whether Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture alone to them that believe it, be not a ſufficient guide, I leave it to you to judge. And are not his words juſt as if a man ſhould ſay, If God had not given us the light of the Sun, we muſt have made uſe of Candles and Torches: If we had had no Eyes, we muſt have felt out our way: If we had no Leggs, we muſt have uſed Crutches. And doth not this in effect import, that while we have the Sun, we need no Candles? While we have our Eyes, we need not feel out our way? While we enjoy our Leggs, we need not Crutches? And by like reaſon, <hi>Irenaeus</hi> in ſaying, <hi>If we had no Scripture, we muſt have followed Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and they that have none, do well to do ſo,</hi> doth he not plainly import, that to them that have Scripture, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it, Tradition is unneceſſary? which could not be, if the Scripture did not contain evidently the whole tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Which whether <hi>Irenaeus</hi> believed or no, theſe words of his may inform you, <hi>Non enim per alios</hi> &amp;c. <hi>we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the diſpoſition of our Salvation from no others, but from them, by whom the Goſpel came unto us. Which Goſpel truly, the Apoſtles firſt preached, and afterwards by the will of God, delivered in writing to us, to be the Pillar and Foundation of our Faith.</hi>

His firſt <hi>Notandum</hi> is, <hi>That in the Chriſtian Doctrin, ſome things are ſimply neceſſary for the Salvation of all men; as the knowledge of the Articles of the
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:57896:77"/>Apoſtles Creed; and beſides the knowledge, of the ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, and ſome of the Sacraments. Other things not ſo neceſſary, but that a man may be ſaved, without the explicit knowledge and belief, and profeſſion of them.</hi> His Second Note is, <hi>That thoſe things which were ſimply neceſſary, the Apoſtles were wont to preach to all men; But of other things not all to all, but ſomething to all, to wit, thoſe things which were profitable for all, other things only to Prelats and Prieſts.</hi> Theſe things premiſed, he acknowledgeth, <hi>That all thoſe things were written by the Apoſtles, which are neceſſary for all, and which they were wont openly to preach to all; But that other things were not all written: And therefore, when</hi> Irenaeus <hi>ſays that the Apoſtles wrote what they Preach in the World, it is true,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>and not againſt Traditions, becauſe they preached not to the People all things, but only thoſe things, which were neceſſary or profitable for them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="145">145. So that at the moſt, you can infer from hence, but only a ſuppoſitive neceſſity of having an infallible Guide, and that grounded upon a falſe ſuppoſition, In caſe we had no Scripture, but an abſolute neceſſity here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and to them who have and believe the Scripture, which is your aſſumption, cannot with any colour from hence be concluded, but rather the contrary.</p>
                     <p n="146">146. Neither becauſe (as he ſays) it was <hi>then eaſie to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Truth from Gods Church, then,</hi> in the Age next af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Apoſtles, Then, when all the ancient and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolick Churches were at an agreement about the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals of Faith: Will it therefore follow that now, 1600 years after, when the ancient Churches are divided almoſt into as many Religions as they are Churches, every one being the Church to it ſelf, and heretical to all other, that it is as eaſie, but extremely difficult or rather impoſſible, to find the Church firſt independently of the true Doctrin, and then to find the truth by the Church.</p>
                     <p n="148">148. Neither will the <hi>Apoſtles depoſiting with the Church, all things belonging to truth,</hi> be any proof that the Church ſhall certainly keep this <hi>depoſitum,</hi> entire, and ſincere, without adding to it, or taking from it; for this whole <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitum</hi> was committed to every particular Church, nay, to
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:57896:77"/>every particular Man, which the Apoſtles converted. And yet no man, I think, will ſay, that there was any certainty, that it ſhould be kept whole and inviolate by every man, and every Church. It is apparent out of Scripture, it was committed to <hi>Timothy,</hi> and by him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to other faithful men: and yet S. <hi>Paul</hi> thought it not ſuperfluous, earneſtly to exhort him to the careful keeping of it: which exhortation you muſt grant had been vain and ſuperfluous, if the not keeping of it had been impoſſible. And therefore though <hi>Irenaeus</hi> ſays, <hi>The Apoſtles fully depoſited in the Church all truth,</hi> yet he ſays not, neither can we infer from what he ſays, that the Church ſhould always infallibly keep this <hi>depoſitum,</hi> entire without the loſs of any truth, and ſincere with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the mixture of any falſhood.</p>
                     <p n="149">149. Ad §. 25.] <hi>C.

For either they have certain and infallible means not to Err in interpreting; or not. If not, Scripture to them can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be a ſufficient ground for infallible Faith: If they have, and ſo cannot Err in interpreting Scripture, then they are able with infallibility to hear and determine all Controverſies of Faith; and ſo they may be, and are Judges of Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, although they uſe the Scripture as a Rule. And thus againſt their own Doctrine, they conſtitute another Judge of Controverſies beſides Scripture alone.</hi>

For either they have cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and infallible means not to Err, in the choice of the Church, and interpreting her decrees, or they have not: If not, then the Church to them cannot be a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient (but meerly a phantaſtical) ground for infallible Faith, nor a meet Judge of Controverſies: (For unleſs I be infallibly ſure that the Church is infallible, how can I be upon her Authority infallibly ſure, that any thing ſhe ſays is infallible?) If they have certain infallible means, and ſo cannot Err in the choice of their Church, and in
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:57896:78"/>interpreting her decrees, then they are able with Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility to hear, examine, and determine all Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies of Faith, although they pretend to make the Church their Guide, And thus againſt their own Doctrine, they conſtitute another Judge of Controverſies, beſides the Church alone. Nay every one makes himſelf a chooſer of his own Religion, and of his own ſenſe of the Churches decrees, which very thing in <hi>Proteſtants</hi> they ſo highly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn: and ſo in judging others, condemn themſelves.</p>
                     <p n="150">150. Neither in ſaying thus have I only cried quittance with you: but that you may ſee how much you are in my debt, I will ſhew unto you, that for your Sophiſm a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our way, I have given you a Demonſtration againſt yours. Firſt, I ſay, your Argument againſt us, is a tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſparent fallacy. The firſt part of it lies thus: <hi>Proteſtants</hi> have no means to interpret, without Error, obſcure and ambiguous places of Scripture; therefore plain places of Scripture cannot be to them a ſufficient ground of Faith. But though we pretend not to certain means of not Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, in interpreting all Scripture, particularly ſuch places as are obſcure and ambiguous, yet this methinks ſhould be no impediment but that we may have certainmeans of not Erring in and about the ſenſe of thoſe places, which are ſo plain and clear that they need no Interpreters; and in ſuch we ſay our Faith is contained. If you ask me how I can be ſure that I know the true <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>

                        </gap> that you underſtand what I, or any man elſe ſays? They that heard our Saviour and the Apoſtles Preach, could they have ſufficient aſſurance, that they underſtood at any time, what they would have them do? if not, to what end did they hear them? If they could, why may we not be as well aſſured, that we underſtand ſufficiently, what we conceive plain in their writings?</p>
                     <p n="151">151. Again I pray tell us, whether you do certainly know the ſenſe of theſe Scriptures, with which you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend you are led to the knowledg of your Church? If you do not, how know you that there is any Church Infallible, and that theſe are the Notes of it, and that,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:57896:78"/>this is the Church that hath theſe Notes? If you do, then give us leave to have the ſame means, and the ſame abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities to know other plain places, which you have to know theſe. For if all Scripture be obſcure, how come you to know the ſenſe of theſe places? If ſome places of it be plain, why ſhould we ſtay here?</p>
                     <p n="152">152. And now, to come to the other part of your di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemma; in ſaying, <hi>If they have certain means, and ſo can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not Err,</hi> methinks you forget your ſelf very much, and ſeem to make no difference, between, having certain means to do a thing, and the actual doing of it. As if you ſhould conclude, becauſe all men have certain means of Salvation, therefore all men certainly muſt be ſaved, and cannot do otherwiſe; as if whoſoever had a Horſe muſt preſently get up and Ride; Whoſoever had means to find out a way, could not neglect thoſe means and ſo miſtake it, God be thanked, that we have ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent means to be certain enough of the truth of our Faith. But the Priviledge of not being in poſſibility of Erring, that we challenge not, becauſe we have as little reaſon as you to do ſo: and you have none at all. If you ask, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we may poſſibly Err, how can we be aſſured we do not? I ask you again, ſeeing your Eye-ſight may deceive you, how can you be ſure you ſee the Sun, when you do ſee it? Perhaps you may be in a dream, and perhaps you, and all the men in the World have been ſo, when they thought they were awake, and then only awake, when they thought they Dreamt. But this I am ſure of, as ſure as that God is good, that he will require no impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities of us: not an Infallible, nor a certainly—uner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring belief, unleſs he hath given us certain means to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void Error; and if we uſe thoſe which we have, will never require of us, that we uſe that which we have not.</p>
                     <p n="153">153. Now from this miſtaken ground, that it is all one to have means of avoiding Error, and to be in no danger nor poſſibility of Error; You infer upon us as an abſurd concluſion, <hi>That we make our ſelves able to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine Controverſies of Faith with Infallibility, and Judges of Controverſies.</hi> For the latter part of this inference, we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:57896:79"/>and embrace it. We do make our ſelves Judges of Controverſies: that is, we do make uſe of our own under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding in the choice of our Religion. But this, if it be a crime, is common to us with you, (as I have proved above) and the difference is, not that we are chooſers, and you not chooſers, but that we, as we conceive, chooſe wiſely, but you being wilfully blind chooſe to follow thoſe that are ſo too; not remembring what our Saviour hath told you, <hi>when the Blind lead the Blind, both ſhall fall into the Ditch.</hi> But then again I muſt tell you, you have done ill to confound together, Judges, and infallible Judges; unleſs you will ſay, either that we have no Judges in our Courts of Civil judicature, or that they are all Infallible.</p>
                     <p n="154">154. Thus have we caſt off your dilemma, and broken both the Horns of it. But now my retortion lies heavy upon you, and will not be turned off. For firſt you content not your ſelves with a moral certainty of the things you believe, nor with ſuch a degree of aſſurance of them, as is ſufficient to produce obedience to the condition of the new Covenant, which is all that we require. Gods Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, if he pleaſe, may Work more, and certainty of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence beyond a certainty of evidence. But neither God doth, nor man may require of us, as our Duty, to give a greater aſſent to the concluſion than the premiſes deſerve; to build an infallible Faith upon Motives that are only highly credible, and not infallible, as it were a great and heavy building upon a Foundation that hath not ſtrength proportionable. But though God require not of us ſuch unreaſonable things, You do, and tell men they cannot be ſaved, unleſs they believe your Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals with an infallible Faith. To which end they muſt believe alſo your Propounder, your Church, to be ſimply Infallible. Now how is it poſſible for them to give a rational aſſent to the Churches infallibility, unleſs they have ſome infallible means to know that ſhe is infallible? Neither can they infallibly know the infallibility of this means, but by ſome other, and ſo on for ever: unleſs they can dig ſo deep as to come at length to the Rock, that is, <hi>to ſettle all upon ſomething evident of it ſelf,</hi> which
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:57896:79"/>is not ſo much as pretended. But the laſt reſolution of all is into Motives, which indeed upon examination will ſcarce appear probable, but are not ſo much as avouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be any more than very credible. For example, if I ask you why you do believe Tranſubſtantiation? What can you anſwer, but becauſe it is a Revelation of the prime Verity. I demand again, how can you aſſure your ſelf or me of that, being ready to embrace it if it may appear to be ſo? And what can you ſay, but that you know it to be ſo, becauſe the Church ſays ſo, which is Infallible. If I ask, what mean You by your Church? You can tell me nothing, but the Company of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans which adhere to the <hi>Pope.</hi> I demand then laſtly: Why ſhould I believe this Company to be the Infallible Propounder of Divine Revelation? And then you tell me, that there are many Motives to induce a Man to this belief. But are theſe Motives laſtly infallible? No ſay you, but very credible. Well, let them paſs for ſuch, becauſe now we have not leiſure to examine them. Yet methinks ſeeing the Motives to believe the Churches in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility, are only very credible, it ſhould alſo be but as credible that your Church is Infallible, and as credible, and no more, perhaps ſomewhat leſs, that her Propoſals, particularly Tranſubſtantiation, are Divine Revelations. And methinks You ſhould require only a Moral, and Modeſt aſſent to them, and not a Divine as you call it, and Infallible Faith. But then of theſe Motives to the Churches Infallibility, I hope you will give us leave to conſider, and judge whether they be indeed Motives, and ſufficient; or whether they be not Motiues at all, or not ſufficient; or whether theſe Motives or Inducements to your Church be not impeached, and oppoſed with Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſives, and enforcements, from it; or laſtly, whether theſe Motives which You uſe, be not indeed only Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to Chriſtianity, and not to <hi>Popery:</hi> give me leave for diſtinction ſake to call your Religion ſo. If we may not judge of theſe things, how can my judgment be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with that which comes not within its cognizance? If I may, then at leaſt I am to be a Judge of all theſe
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:57896:80"/>Controverſies. 1. Whether every one of theſe Motives be indeed a Motive to any Church? 2. If to ſome, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to Yours? 3. If to Yours, whether ſufficient, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient? 4. Whether other Societies have not as many, and as great Motives to draw me to them? 5. Whether I have not greater reaſon to believe you do Err, than that you cannot? And now Sir I pray let me trouble You with a few more Queſtions. Am I a ſufficient Judge of theſe Controverſies, or no? If of theſe, why ſhall I ſtay here, why not of others? Why not of all? Nay doth not the true examining of theſe few, contain and lay upon me the examination of all? What other Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to your Church have you, but your Notes of it? <hi>Bellarmine</hi> gives ſome 14. or 15. And one of theſe fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen contains in it the examination of all Controverſies, and not only ſo, but of all uncontroverted Doctrines. For how ſhall I, or can I know the Church of <hi>Romes</hi> confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity with the Ancient Church, unleſs I know firſt what the Ancient Church did hold, and then what the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth hold; and laſtly, whether they be conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, or if in my judgment they ſeem not conformable, I am then to think the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> not to be the Church, for want of the Note which ſhe pretends is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and perpetual to it. So that for ought I can ſee, Judges we are and muſt be of all ſides, every one for himſelf, and God for us all.</p>
                     <p n="155">155. §. 26.] C. M. <hi>I ask, whether this Aſſertion (Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture alone is Judge of all Controverſies in Faith) be a Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental point of Faith or no?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>CHIL.</hi> I anſwer; This aſſertion, that <hi>Scripture alone is Judge of all Controverſies in Faith,</hi> if it be taken proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, is neither a Fundamental nor Unfundamental point of Faith, nor no point of Faith at all, but a plain falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. It is not <hi>a Judge of Controverſies but a Rule to Judge them by;</hi> and that not an abſolutely perfect Rule, but as perfect as a written Rule can be; which muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways need ſomething elſe, which is either evidently true, or evidently credible to give atteſtation to it, and that in this caſe is Univerſal Tradition. So that Univerſal Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:57896:80"/>is the Rule to judge all Controverſies by. But then becauſe nothing beſides Scripture, comes to us with as full a ſtream of Tradition as Scripture, Scripture alone, and no unwritten Doctrine, nor no Infallibility of any Church, having atteſtation from Tradition truly Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal; for this reaſon we conceive, as the Apoſtles perſons while they were living were the only Judges of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies, ſo their Writings, now they are dead, are the only Rule for us to judge them by: There being nothing unwritten, which can go in upon half ſo fair Cards, for the Title of Apoſtolick Tradition, as theſe things which by the confeſſion of both Sides are not ſo: I mean <hi>the Doctrine of the Millinaries,</hi> and <hi>of the neceſſity of the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt for Infants.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="156">156. Yet when we ſay, the Scripture is the only Rule to Judge all Controverſies by, methinks you ſhould eaſily conceive, that we would be underſtood of all thoſe that are poſſible to be Judged by Scripture, and of thoſe that ariſe among ſuch as believe the Scripture. For if I had a Controverſie with an <hi>Atheiſt</hi> whether there were a God or no, I would not ſay, that the Scripture were a Rule to judge this by: ſeeing that doubting whether there be a God or no, he muſt needs doubt whether the Scripture be the Word of God: or if he does not, he grants the Queſtion, and is not the man we ſpeak of. So likewiſe, if I had a Controverſie about the Truth of Chriſt with a <hi>Jew,</hi> it would be vainly done of me, ſhould I preſs him with the Authority of the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> which he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves not, until out of ſome Principles common to us both, I had perſuaded him that it is the Word of God. The <hi>New Teſtament</hi> therefore while he remains a <hi>Jew</hi> would not be a fit Rule to decide this Controverſie; In as much as that which is doubted of it ſelf, is not fit to determine other doubts. So likewiſe if there were any that believed Chriſtian Religion, and yet believed not the Bible to be the Word of God, though they believed the matter of it to be true, (which is no impoſſible ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, for I may believe a Book of S. <hi>Auſtines,</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain nothing but the Truth of God, and yet not to have
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:57896:81"/>been inſpired by God himſelf,) againſt ſuch men there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there were no diſputing out of the Bible; becauſe nothing in queſtion can be a proof to it ſelf. When therefore we ſay the Scripture is a ſufficient means to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine all Controverſies, we ſay not this, either to <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts, Jews, Turks,</hi> or ſuch Chriſtians (if there be any ſuch) as believe not Scripture to be the Word of God. But among ſuch men only, as are already agreed upon this, That the Scripture is the Word of God, we ſay all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies that ariſe about Faith, are either not at all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidable and conſequently not neceſſary to be believed one way or other, or they may be determined by Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture. In a Word, That all things neceſſary to be believed are evidently contained in Scripture, and what is not there evidently contained, cannot be neceſſary to be believed. And our reaſon hereof is convincing; becauſe nothing can Challenge our belief, but what hath deſcended to us from Chriſt by Original and Univerſal Tradition: Now nothing but Scripture hath thus deſcended to us, There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore nothing but Scripture can Challenge our belief. Now then to come up cloſer to you, and to anſwer to your Queſtion, not as you put it, but as you ſhould have put it: I ſay, That this poſition, <hi>Scripture alone is the Rule whereby they which believe it to be Gods Word are to judge all Controverſies in Faith,</hi> is no fundamental point. Though not for your Reaſons: For your firſt and ſtrongeſt reaſon you ſee is plainly voided and cut off by my ſtating of the Queſtion as I have done, and ſuppoſing in it that the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties at variance are agreed about this, That the Scripture is the Word of God; and conſequently that this is none of their Controverſies. To your ſecond, That <hi>Controverſies cannot be ended without ſome living Authority,</hi> We have ſaid already, that neceſſary Controverſies may be and are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided. And if they be not ended, this is not through de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of the Rule, but through the default of Men. And for theſe that cannot thus be ended, it is not neceſſary they ſhould be ended. For if God did require the ending of them, he would have provided ſome certain means for the ending of them. And to your Third, I ſay, that
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:57896:81"/>your pretence of uſing theſe means is but hypocrital: for you uſe them with prejudice, and with a ſetled reſolution not to believe any thing which theſe means happily may ſuggeſt into you, if it any way croſs your pre-conceived perſwaſion of your Churches infallibility. You give not your ſelves liberty of judgment in the uſe of them, nor ſuffer your ſelves to be led by them to the Truth, to which they would lead you, would you but be as willing to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve this conſequence, Our Church doth oppoſe Scripture, therefore it doth err, therefore it is not Infallible, as you are reſolute to believe this, The Church is Infallible, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it doth not err, and therefore it doth not oppoſe Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, though it ſeem to do ſo never ſo plainly.</p>
                     <p n="157">157. You pray, but it is not that God would bring you to the true Religion, but that he would confirm you in your own. You confer places, but it is that you may confirm, or colour over with plauſible diſguiſes your er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous doctrine, not that you may judge of them and forſake them if there be reaſon for it. You conſult the Originals, but you regard them not when they make againſt your Doctrin or Tranſlation.</p>
                     <p n="159">159. Notwithſtanding, though not for theſe reaſons, yet for others, I conceive this Doctrin not Fundamental: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe if a man ſhould believe Chriſtian Religion wholly, and entirely, and live according to it, ſuch a man, though he ſhould not know or not believe the Scripture to be a Rule of Faith, no nor to be the Word of God, my opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is he may be ſaved; and my reaſon is, becauſe he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms the entire condition of the new Covenant, which is, that we believe the matter of the Goſpel, and not that it is contained in theſe or theſe Books. So that the Books of Scripture are not ſo much the objects of our Faith, as the inſtruments of conveying it to our underſtanding; and not ſo much of the being of the Chriſtian Doctrin, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to the well-being of it. <hi>Iraeneus</hi> tells us (as M. K. acknowledgeth) of ſome barbarous Nations, that <hi>believed the Doctrin of Chriſt, and yet believed not the Scripture to be the Word of God, for they never heard of it, and Faith comes by hearing:</hi> But theſe barbarous people might be ſaved:
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:57896:82" rendition="simple:additions"/>therefore men might be ſaved without believing the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture to be the Word of God; much more without belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it to be a Rule, and a perfect Rule of Faith. Neither doubt I, but if the Books of Scripture had been propoſed to them by the other parts of the Church, where they had been before received, and had been doubted of, or even rejected by thoſe barbarous Nations, but ſtill by the bare belief and practice of Chriſtianity, they might be ſaved: God requiring of us under pain of damnation, only to believe the verities therein contained, and not the divine Authority of the Books wherein they are contained. Not but that it were now very ſtrange and unreaſonable, if a man ſhould believe the matter of theſe Books, and not the Authority of the Books: and therefore if a man ſhould profeſs the not believing of theſe, I ſhould have reaſon to fear he did not believe that. But there is not always an equal neceſſity for the belief of thoſe things, for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief whereof there is an equal reaſon. We have I believe as great reaſon to believe there was ſuch a man as <hi>Henry the VIII. King of England,</hi> as that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> ſuffered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Pontius Pilate:</hi> yet this is neceſſary to be believed, and that is not ſo. So that if any man ſhould doubt of or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believe that, it were moſt unreaſonably done of him, yet it were no mortal ſin, nor no ſin at all: God having no where commanded men under pain of damnation to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve all which reaſon induceth them to believe. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as an Executor, that ſhould perform the whole Will of the dead, ſhould fully ſatisfie the Law, though he did not believe that Parchment to be his written Will, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is ſo: So I believe, that he who believes all the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular doctrines which integrate Chriſtianity, and lives according to them, ſhould be ſaved, though he neither believed nor knew that the Goſpels were written by the Evangeliſts, or the Epiſtles by the Apoſtles.</p>
                     <p n="160">160. This diſcourſe whether it be rational and conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding or no, I ſubmit to better judgment; But ſure I am, that the corollary which you draw from this poſition, <hi>that this point is not Fundamental,</hi> is very inconſequent; that is, <hi>that we are uncertain of the truth of it,</hi> becauſe we ſay the
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:57896:82"/>whole Church, much more particular Churches and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate men may err in points not Fundamental. A pretty Sophiſm, depending upon this Principle, that whoſoever poſſibly may err, he cannot be certain that he doth not err. And upon this ground, what ſhall hinder me from concluding, that ſeeing you alſo hold, that neither parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Churches, nor private men are Infallible even in Fundamentals, that even the Fundamentals of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, remain to you uncertain? A Judge may poſſibly err in judgment, can he therefore never have aſſurance that he hath judged right? A Traveller may poſſibly miſtake his way, muſt I therefore be doubtful whether I am in the right way from my Hall to my Chamber? Or can our <hi>London</hi> Carrier have no certainty, in the middle of the day, when he is ſober and in his wits, that he is in the way to <hi>London?</hi> Theſe you ſee are right worthy conſequences, and yet they are as like your own, as an Egg to an Egg, or Milk to Milk.</p>

He ſays not that Chriſt has recommended the Church to us for <hi>an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible definer of all emergent controverſies,</hi> but for a <hi>credible witneſs of Ancient Tradition.</hi> Whoſoever therefore refuſeth to follow the practice of the Church (underſtand <hi>of all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and ages</hi>) though he be thought to reſiſt our Saviour, what is that to us, who caſt off no practiecs of the Church, but ſuch as are evidently poſt-nate to the time of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and plainly contrary to the practice of former and purer times. Laſtly it is evident, and even to impudence it ſelf undeniable, that upon this ground, of believing all things taught by the preſent Church as taught by Chriſt, Error was held, for example, the neceſſity of the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt for Infants, and that in S. <hi>Auſtines</hi> time, and that by S. <hi>Auſtine</hi> himſelf: and therefore without controverſie this is no certain ground for truth, which may ſupport falſhood as well as truth.</p>
                     <p n="164">164. To the Argument wherewith you conclude, I An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, That though the viſible Church ſhall always with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fail propoſe ſo much of Gods revelation, as is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to bring men to Heaven, for otherwiſe it will not be the viſible Church, yet it may ſometimes add to this reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation things ſuperfluous, nay hurtful, nay in themſelves damnable, though not unpardonable; and ſometimes take from it things very expedient and profitable, and therefore
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:57896:83"/>it is poſſible, without ſin, to reſiſt in ſome things the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church of Chriſt. But you preſs us farther, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, <hi>what Viſible Church was extant, when</hi> Luther <hi>began, whether it were the</hi> Roman <hi>or</hi> Proteſtant <hi>Church?</hi> As if it muſt of neceſſity either be <hi>Proteſtant</hi> or <hi>Roman,</hi> or <hi>Roman</hi> of neceſſity, if it were not <hi>Proteſtant!</hi> yet this is the moſt uſual fallacy of all your diſputers, by ſome ſpecious Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to perſwade weak men that the Church of <hi>Proteſtants</hi> cannot be the true Church; and thence to infer, that without doubt it muſt be the <hi>Roman.</hi> But why may not the <hi>Roman</hi> be content to be a part of it, and the <hi>Grecian</hi> another? And if one muſt be the whole, why not the <hi>Greek</hi> Church, as well as the <hi>Roman?</hi> there being not one Note of your Church which agrees not to her as well as to your own; unleſs it be, that ſhe is poor, and oppreſſed by the <hi>Turk,</hi> and you are in glory and ſplendor.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>Wherein it is maintained, That the diſtinction of points <hi>Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental</hi> and not <hi>Fundamental,</hi> is in this preſent Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie good and pertinent: And that the Catholick Church may err in the latter kind of the ſaid points.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p n="1">1. This diſtinction is imployed by <hi>Proteſtants</hi> to many purpoſes, and therefore if it be pertinent and good, (as they underſtand and apply it) the whole Edifice built thereon, muſt be either firm and ſtable, or if it be not, it cannot be for any default in this diſtinction.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>If you object to them diſcords in matter of faith without any means of agreement,</hi> They will anſwer you, that they want not good and ſolid means of agreement in matters neceſſary to ſalvation, <hi>viz.</hi> Their belief of all thoſe things which are plainly and undoubtedly delivered in Scripture; which who ſo believes, muſt of neceſſity believe all things neceſſary to ſalvation: and their mutual ſuffering one
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:57896:84"/>another, <hi>to abound in their ſeveral ſenſe,</hi> in matters not plainly and undoubtedly there delivered. And for their agreement in all Controverſies of Religion, either they have means to agree about them, or not: If you ſay they have, why did you before deny it? If they have not means, why do you find fault with them, for not agreeing?</p>
                     <p n="3">3. You will ſay, that their fault is, that by <hi>remaining</hi> Proteſtants <hi>they exclude themſelves from the means of agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which you have,</hi> and which by ſubmiſſion to your Church they might have alſo. But if you have means of agreement, the more ſhame for you that you ſtill diſagree. For who, I pray, is more inexcuſably guilty, for the omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of any duty; they that either have no means to do it, or elſe know of none they have, which puts them in the ſame caſe as if they had none: or they which profeſs to have an eaſie and expedite means to do it, and yet ſtill leave it undone? <hi>If you had been blind</hi> (ſaith our <hi>Saviour</hi> to the <hi>Phariſees</hi>) <hi>you had had no ſin, but now you ſay you ſee, therefore your ſin remaineth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. If you ſay, you <hi>do agree in matters of Faith,</hi> I ſay this is ridiculous: for you define matters of Faith to be thoſe wherein you agree. So that to ſay, you agree in <hi>matters of Faith,</hi> is to ſay, you agree in thoſe things wherein you do agree. And do not <hi>Proteſtants</hi> do ſo likewiſe? Do not they agree in thoſe things, wherein they do agree?</p>
                     <p n="5">5. But <hi>you are all agreed that only thoſe things wherein you do agree are matters of Faith.</hi> And <hi>Proteſtants</hi> if they were wiſe, would do ſo too. Sure I am they have reaſon enough to do ſo: ſeeing all of them agree with explicite Faith in all thoſe things, which are plainly and undoubtedly deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in Scripture, that is, in all which God hath plainly revealed: and with an implicite Faith, in that ſenſe of the whole Scripture which God intended whatſoever it was. Secondly, That which you pretend is falſe; for elſe, why do ſome of you hold it againſt Faith, to take or allow the <hi>Oath of Allegiance,</hi> others as learned and honeſt as they, that it is againſt Faith and unlawful to refuſe it and allow the refuſing of it? Why do ſome of you hold, that it is <hi>de Fide,</hi> that the Pope is Head of the Church by divine
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:57896:84"/>Law, others the contrary? Some hold it <hi>de Fide,</hi> that the Bleſſed Virgin was free from Actual ſin, others that it is not ſo. Some, that the <hi>Popes</hi> indirect power over Princes in temporalties is <hi>de Fide,</hi> Others the contrary. Some, that it is Univerſal Tradition, and conſequently <hi>de Fide,</hi> that the <hi>Virgin Mary</hi> was conceived in original ſin, others the contrary.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. But what ſhall we ſay now, if you be not agreed touching your pretended means of agreement, how then can you pretend to Unity either Actual or Potential more than <hi>Proteſtants</hi> may? Some of you ſay, the <hi>Pope</hi> alone without a Council may determine all Controverſies: But others deny it. Some, that a General Council without a <hi>Pope</hi> may do ſo: Others deny this. Some, Both in conjunction are infallible determiners: Others again de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny this. Laſtly, ſome among you, hold the Acceptation of the decrees of Councils by the Univerſal Church to be the only way to decide Controverſies: which others deny, by denying the Church to be Infallible. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed what way of ending Cotroverſies can this be, when either part may pretend, that they are part of the Church, and they receive not the decree, therefore the whole Church hath not received it?</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Again, Means of agreeing differences are either Rational and well grounded and of Gods appointment, or voluntary and taken up at the pleaſure of men. Means of the former nature, we ſay, you have as little as we. For where hath God appointed, that the <hi>Pope,</hi> or a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, or a Council confirmed by the <hi>Pope,</hi> or that Society of Chriſtians which adhere to him, ſhall be the <hi>Infallible Judge of Controverſies.</hi> I deſire you to ſhew any one of theſe Aſſertions plainly ſet down in Scripture, (as in all Reaſon a thing of this nature ſhould be) or at leaſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered with a full conſent of Fathers, or at leaſt taught in plain terms by any one Father for four Hundred years after <hi>Chriſt.</hi> And if you cannot do this (as I am ſure you cannot) and yet will ſtill be obtruding your ſelves upon us for our Judges, who will not cry out, —<hi>periſſe frontem de rebus?</hi> that you have loſt all modeſty?</p>
                     <pb n="168" facs="tcp:57896:85"/>
                     <p n="8">8. But then for means of the other kind, ſuch as yours are, we have great abundance of them. For beſides all the ways which you have deviſed, which we may make uſe of when we pleaſe, we have a great many more, which you yet have never thought of, for which we have as good colour out of Scripture as you have for yours. For firſt, we could if we would, try it by Lots, whoſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is true, and whoſe falſe. And you know it is written,

And if you ſay theſe would fail us, and contradict themſelves; ſo, as we pretend, have yours. There have been <hi>Popes</hi> againſt <hi>Popes:</hi> Councils againſt Councils: Councils confirmed by <hi>Popes,</hi> againſt Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils confirmed by <hi>Popes:</hi> Laſtly, the Church of ſome Ages againſt the Church of other Ages.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. Laſtly, whereas you find fault, <hi>That</hi> Proteſtants <hi>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braided with their diſcords, anſwer that they differ only in points not Fundamental,</hi> I deſire you tell me whether they do ſo, or do not ſo; If they do ſo, I hope you will not find fault with the Anſwer: If you ſay they do not ſo, but in points Fundamental alſo; then they are not mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the ſame Church one with another, no more than with you: And therefore why ſhould you object to any of them, their differences from each other, any more than to your ſelves, their more and greater differences from you?</p>
                     <p n="10">10. But <hi>they are convinced ſometime even by their own confeſſions, that the Ancient Fathers taught divers points of Popery: and then they reply, thoſe Fathers may nevertheleſs be ſaved, becauſe thoſe Errors were not Fundamental.</hi> And may not you alſo be convinced by the confeſſions of your own men, that the Fathers taught divers points held by <hi>Proteſtants</hi> againſt the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and divers againſt <hi>Proteſtants</hi> and the Church of <hi>Rome?</hi> Do not your Purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Indexes,</hi> clip the Tongues, and ſeal up the Lips of a great many for ſuch confeſſions? And is not the above cited confeſſion of your <hi>Doway</hi> Divines, plain and full to the ſame purpoſe? And do not you alſo, as freely as we, charge the Fathers with Errors, and yet ſay they were ſaved? Now what elſe do we underſtand by an <hi>unfundamental</hi> Error, but ſuch a one with which a man may poſſibly be ſaved? So that ſtill you proceed in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning others for your own faults, and urging argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:57896:86"/>againſt us, which return more ſtrongly upon your ſelves.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. But your will is, <hi>we ſhould remember that Chriſt muſt alwaies have a viſible Church.</hi> Anſw. Your pleaſure ſhall be obeyed, on condition you will not forget, that there is a difference between perpetual Viſibility, and perpetual Purity. As for the anſwer, which you make for us, true it is, we believe the <hi>Catholick Church cannot periſh,</hi> yet that ſhe may, and did Err in points not Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal; and that <hi>Proteſtants</hi> were obliged to forſake theſe Errors of the Church, as they did, though not the Church for her Errors, for that they did not, but continued ſtill members of the Church. For it is not all one (though you perpetually confound them) <hi>to forſake the Errors of the Church,</hi> and to <hi>forſake the Church:</hi> or to <hi>forſake the Church in her Errors,</hi> and <hi>ſimply to forſake the Church:</hi> No more than it is for me to renounce my Brothers or my Friends Vices or Errors, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce my Brother or my Friend. The former then was done by <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> the latter was not done. Nay not only not from the <hi>Catholick,</hi> but not ſo much as from the <hi>Roman,</hi> did they ſeparate <hi>per omnia,</hi> but only in thoſe practices which they conceived ſuperſtitious or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious. If you would at this time propoſe a form of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy, which both Sides hold lawful, and then they would not joyn with you in this Liturgy, you might have ſome colour then to ſay, they renounce your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion abſolutely. But as things are now ordered, they cannot joyn with you in prayers, but they muſt partake with you in unlawful practices, and for this reaſon, they <hi>(not abſolutely, but thus far)</hi> ſeparate from your commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. And this, I ſay, they were obliged to do under pain of damnation. <hi>Not as if it were damnable to hold an Error not damnable,</hi> but becauſe it is damnable out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly to profeſs and maintain it, and to joyn with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in the practice of it, when inwardly they did not hold it. Now had they continued in your communion, that they muſt have done, <hi>vid.</hi> have profeſſed to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and externally practiſed your Errors, whereof they
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:57896:86"/>were convinced that they were Errors: which though the matters of the Errors had been not neceſſary, but only profitable, whether it had not been damnable diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimulation and Hypocriſie, I leave it to you to Judge. You your ſelf tell us within two pages after this, <hi>that you are obliged never to ſpeak any one leaſt lie againſt your knowledge,</hi> §, 2. now what is this but to live in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual lie?</p>
                     <p n="12">12. As for that which in the next place you ſeem ſo to wonder at, That <hi>both</hi> Catholicks <hi>and</hi> Proteſtants, <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the opinion of</hi> Proteſtants, <hi>may be ſaved in their ſeveral profeſſions, becauſe forſooth, we both agree in all Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental points:</hi> I Anſwer, this propoſition ſo crudely ſet down, as you have here ſet it down, I know no <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant</hi> will juſtifie. For you ſeem to make them teach, that it is an indifferent thing, for the attainment of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, whether a man believe the Truth or the Falſhood; and that they care not in whether of theſe Religions a man live or die, ſo he die in either of them: whereas all that they ſay is this, That thoſe amongſt you which want means to find the Truth and ſo die in Error, or uſe the beſt means they can with induſtry, and without partiality to find the Truth, and yet die in Error, theſe men, thus qualified, notwithſtanding theſe Errors may be ſaved. Secondly, for thoſe that have means to find the Truth, and will not uſe them, they conceive, though their caſe be dangerous, yet if they die with a general repentance for all their ſins, known and unknown, their Salvation is not deſperate. The Truths which they hold, of Faith in Chriſt, and Repentance, being as it were an Antidote againſt their Errors, and their negligence in ſeeking the Truth. Eſpecially ſeeing by confeſſion of both ſides we agree in much more than is ſimply, and indiſpenſably neceſſary to ſalvation.</p>

<note n="b" place="margin">Heb. 6.11.</note> 
                        <hi>That God is, and that he is a rewarder of them that ſeek him;</hi> and to whom thus much only is given, to them it ſhall not be damnable, that they believe but only thus much. Which methinks is very manifeſt from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, in the <hi>Epiſt. to the Heb.</hi> where having firſt ſaid, <hi>that without Faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God,</hi> he ſubjoyns as his reaſon, <hi>for whoſoever cometh unto God, muſt believe that God is, and that he is a rewarder of them that ſeek him.</hi> Where in my opinion, this is plainly intimated, that this is the <hi>minimum quòd ſic,</hi> the loweſt degree of Faith, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, in men capable of Faith, God will be pleaſed: and that with this loweſt degree he will be pleaſed, where means of riſing higher are deficient. Beſides, if without this belief, <hi>that God is, and that he is a rewarder of them that ſeek him,</hi> God will not be pleaſed, then his will is that we ſhould believe it. Now his will it cannot be, that we ſhould believe a falſhood: It muſt be therefore true, that he is a rewarder of them that ſeek him. Now it is poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that they which never heard of Chriſt, may ſeek God, therefore it is true that even they ſhall pleaſe him, and be rewarded by him; I ſay rewarded, not with bringing them immediately to Salvation without Chriſt, but with bringing them according to his good pleaſure, firſt, to Faith in Chriſt, and ſo to Salvation. To which belief the ſtory of <hi>Cornelius</hi> in the 10. <hi>chap. of the Acts</hi> of the Apoſtles, and S. <hi>Peters</hi> Words to him, are to me a great inducement. For firſt it is evident he believed not in Chriſt, but was a meer Gentile, and one that knew not but men might be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhiped, and yet we are aſſured <hi>that his Prayers and Alms</hi> (even while he was in that ſtate) <hi>came up for a memorial be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God; That his Prayer was heard, and his Alms had in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance in the ſight of God.</hi> v. 4. that upon this, <hi>Then fearing
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:57896:87"/>God and working righteouſneſs,</hi> (ſuch as it was) <hi>he was accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with God.</hi> But how accepted? Not to be brought im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to Salvation, but to be promoted to a higher degree of the knowledge of Gods will: For ſo it is in the 4. &amp; 5. v. <hi>Call for</hi> Simon <hi>whoſe firname is</hi> Peter, <hi>he ſhall tell thee what thou oughteſt to do,</hi> and at the 33. verſ. <hi>We are all here preſent before God, to hear all things that are commanded thee of God.</hi> So that though even in his Gentiliſm, he was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted in his preſent ſtate, yet if he had continued in it, and refuſed to believe in Chriſt after the ſufficient Revelation of the Goſpel to him, and Gods will to have him believe it, he that was accepted before, would not have continued accepted ſtill; for then that condemnation had come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, <hi>than light was come unto him, and he loved Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs more that Light.</hi> So that (to proceed a ſtep farther) to whom Faith in Chriſt is ſufficiently propounded, as neceſſary to Salvation, to them it is ſimply neceſſary and Fundamental to believe in Chriſt, that is, to expect re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins, and Salvation from him, upon the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of the conditions he requires; among which conditions one is, that we believe what he has revealed ed, when it is ſuficiently declared, to have been reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by him: For by doing ſo, <hi>we ſet to our Seal, that God is true, and that Chriſt was ſent by him.</hi> Now that may be ſufficiently declared to one (all things conſidered,) which, (all things conſidered) to another is not ſufficiently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared: and conſequently that may be Fundamental and neceſſary to one, which to another is not ſo. Which Variety of circumſtances, makes it impoſſible to ſet down an exact Catalogue of Fundamentals, and proves your requeſt as reaſonable, as if you ſhould deſire us (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Fable) to make a Coat to fit the Moon in all her changes; or to give you a Garment that will fit all ſtatures; Or to make you a Dyal to ſerve all Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians; or to deſign particularly, what Proviſion will ſerve an Army for a Year: whereas there may be an Army of Ten Thouſand, there may be of 100000. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore without ſeting down a Catalogue of Fundamentals in particular (becauſe none that can be given, can Univerſally
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:57896:88"/>ſerve for all men, God requiring more of them to whom he gives more, and leſs of them to whom he gives leſs) we muſt content our ſelves by a general deſcription to tell you what is Fundamental. And to warrant us in doing ſo, we have your own example, §. 19. where be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing engaged to give us a Catalogue of Fundamentals, inſtead thereof you tell us only in general, <hi>that all is Fundamental, and not to be disbelieved under pain of damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which the Church hath defined.</hi> As you therefore think it enough to ſay in general, <hi>that all is Fundamental which the Church has defined,</hi> without ſetting down in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar a compleat Catalogue of all things, which in any Age the Church has defined (which I believe you will not undertake to do, and if you do, it will be contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted by your Fellows:) So in reaſon you might think it enough for us alſo to ſay in general, <hi>that it is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for any mans Salvation, to believe that the Scripture is true, and contains all things neceſſary for Salvation; and to do his beſt endeavour to find and believe the true ſenſe of it:</hi> without delivering any particular Catalogue of the Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals of Faith.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. Neither <hi>doth the want of ſuch a Catalogue</hi> leave us in ſuch a <hi>perplexed uncertainty</hi> as you pretend. For though perhaps we cannot exactly diſtinguiſh in the Scripture, what <hi>is revealed becauſe it is neceſſary,</hi> from what is <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary conſequently and accidentally, meerly becauſe it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed:</hi> yet we are ſure enough, that all that is neceſſary any way is there, and therefore in believing all that is there, we are ſure to believe all that is neceſſary. And if we Err from the true and intended ſenſe of ſome, nay of many obſcure or ambiguous Texts of Scripture, yet we may be ſure enough, that we Err not damnably: becauſe, if we do indeed deſire and endeavour to find the Truth, we may be ſure we do ſo, and as ſure that it cannot conſiſt with the revealed goodneſs of God, to damn him for Error, that deſires and indeavours to find the Truth.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. Ad §. 2.] The effect of this Paragraph (for as much as concerns us) is this, <hi>that for any man to deny belief
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:57896:88"/>to any one thing be it great or ſmall known by him, to be revealed by Almighty God for a truth, is in effect to charge God with falſhood: for it is to ſay that God affirms that to be Truth, which he either knows to be not a Truth, or which he doth not know to be a Truth: and therefore without all Controverſie this is a damnable ſin.</hi> To this I ſubſcribe with Hand and Heart: adding withal, that not only he which knows, but he which believes (nay though it be erroneouſly) any thing to be revealed by God, and yet will not believe it, nor aſſent unto it, is in the ſame caſe, and commits the ſame ſin of derogation from Gods moſt perfect and pure Veracity.</p>
                     <p n="16">16. Ad §. 3.] I ſaid purpoſely <hi>(known by himſelf, and believes himſelf)</hi> For as, without any diſparagement of a mans Honeſty, I may believe ſomething to be falſe, which he affirms, of his certain knowledge to be true, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded I neither know nor believe that he has ſo affirmed: So without any the leaſt diſhonour to Gods Eternal ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver failing Veracity, I may doubt of, or deny ſome truth revealed by him, if I neither know nor believe it to be revealed by him.</p>
                     <p n="19">19. But <hi>ignorance of what we are expreſly bound to know, is it ſelf a fault, and therefore cannot be an excuſe:</hi> and therefore if you could ſhew the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> differ in thoſe points, the truth whereof (which can be but one) they were bound expreſly to know, I ſhould eaſily yield that one ſide muſt of neceſſity be in a mortal Crime. But for want of proof of this, you content your ſelf only to ſay it; and therefore I alſo might be contented only to deny it, yet I will not, but give a reaſon for my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial. And my reaſon is, becauſe our obligation expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to know any Divine Truth, muſt ariſe from Gods manifeſt revealing of it, and his revealing unto us that he has revealed it, and that his will is, we ſhould believe it: Now in the points controverted among <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> he hath not ſo dealt with us, therefore he hath not laid any ſuch obligation upon us. The major of this Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logiſm is evident, and therefore I will not ſtand to prove it. The minor alſo will be evident to him that
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:57896:89"/>conſiders, that in all the Controverſies of <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> there is a ſeeming conflict of Scripture with Scripture, Reaſon with Reaſon, Authority with Authority: which how it can conſiſt with the manifeſt revealing of the truth of either Side, I cannot well underſtand. Beſides, though we grant that Scripture, Reaſon and Authority, were all on one ſide, and the apparences of the other ſide all anſwerable: yet if we conſider the ſtrange power that education and prejudices inſtilled by it, have over even excellent underſtandings, we may well imagine, that many truths which in themſelves are revealed plainly enough, are yet to ſuch or ſuch a man, prepoſſeſt with contrary opinions, not revealed plainly. Neither doubt I but God, who knows whereof we are made, and what paſſions we are ſubject unto, will compaſſionate ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, and not enter into judgment with us for thoſe things, which, all things conſidered, were unavoidable.</p>
                     <p n="20">20. Obj. <hi>But till Fundamentals</hi> (ſay you) <hi>be ſufficiently propoſed (as revealed by God) it is not againſt Faith to reject them; or rather it is not poſſible prudently to believe them: And points unfundamental being thus ſufficiently propoſed as divine Truths, may not be denied; Therefore you conclude there is no difference between them: Anſw.</hi> A Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial point, may by accident become Fundamental, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it may be ſo propoſed that the denial of it, will draw after it the denial of this Fundamental truth, <hi>that all which God ſays is true.</hi> Notwithſtanding in themſelves there is a main difference between them: <hi>Points Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal being thoſe only which are revealed by God, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to be Preach'd to all, and believed by all. Points circumſtantial being ſuch, as though God hath revealed them, yet the Paſtors of the Church are not bound under pain of Damnation particularly to teach them unto all men every where, and the People may be ſecurely ig-norant of them.</hi>

                     <p n="21">21. <hi>Obj.</hi> You ſay, <hi>Not Erring in points Fundamental, is not ſufficient for the preſervation of the Church; becauſe any Error maintained by it againſt Gods Revelation is deſtructive.</hi> I anſwer. If you mean againſt Gods Revelation known
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:57896:89"/>by the Church to be ſo, it is true; but impoſſible that the Church ſhould do ſo, for <hi>ipſo Facto</hi> in doing it, it were a Church no longer. But if you mean againſt ſome Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, which the Church by error thinks to be no Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, it is falſe. The Church may ignorantly disbelieve ſuch a Revelation, and yet continue a Church; which thus I prove. That the Goſpel was to be preached to all Nations, was a Truth revealed before our Saviours Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, in theſe words, <hi>Go and teach all Nations. Mat.</hi> 29.19.

                     <p n="24">24. Ad §. 5. This Paragraph, if it be brought out of the Clouds, will I believe have in it theſe Propoſitions. 1. <hi>Things are diſtinguiſhed by their different natures.</hi> 2. <hi>The Nature of Faith is taken, not from the matter believed, for then they that believed different matters ſhould have different Faiths, but from the Motive to it.</hi> 3. <hi>This Motive is Gods Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation.</hi> 4. <hi>This Revelation is alike for all objects.</hi> 5. <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants diſagree in things equally revealed by God: Therefore they forſake the formal motive of Faith: and therefore have no faith nor unity therein.</hi> Which is truly a very proper and convenient argument to cloſe up a weak diſcourſe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in both the Propoſitions are falſe for matter, confuſed and diſordered for the form, and the concluſion utterly in conſequent. Firſt for the ſecond Propoſition, who knows not that the Eſſence of all Habits (and therefore of Faith
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:57896:90"/>among the reſt) is taken from their Act, and their Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject? If the Habit be general, from the Act and Object in general, if the Habit be ſpecial, from the Act and Object in ſpecial. Then for the motive to a thing, that it cannot be of the Eſſence of the thing to which it moves, who can doubt, that knows that a motive is an efficient cauſe: and that the efficient is always extrinſecal to the effect? For the fourth, that <hi>Gods Revelation is alike for all Objects,</hi> It is ambiguous: and if the ſenſe of it be, that his Revelation is an equal Motive to induce us to believe all objects re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed by him, it is true, but impertinent: If the ſenſe of it be, that all objects revealed by God are alike (that is, alike plainly and undoubtedly) revealed by him, it is perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, but moſt untrue. Witneſs the great diverſity of Texts of Scripture, whereof ſome are ſo plain and evident, that no man of ordinary ſenſe can miſtake the ſenſe of them. Some are ſo obſcure and ambiguous, that to ſay this or this is the certain ſenſe of them, were high preſumption. For the 5. <hi>Proteſtants diſagree in things equally revealed by God!</hi> In themſelves perhaps, but not equally to them: whoſe underſtandings by reaſon of their different Educations are faſhioned, and ſhaped for the entertainment of various O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions, and conſequently ſome of them, more inclined to believe ſuch a ſenſe of Scripture, others to believe ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; which to ſay that God will not take into his conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration in judging mens Opinions, is to diſparage his goodneſs. But to what purpoſe is it, that theſe things are equally revealed to both, (as the light is equally revealed to all blind men,) if they be not fully revealed to either? The ſenſe of this Scripture, <hi>Why are they then baptized for the dead?</hi> and this, <hi>He ſhall be ſaved, yet ſo as by fire,</hi> and a thouſand others, is equally revealed to you and to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther interpreter, that is certainly to neither. He now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives one ſenſe of them, and you another; and would it not be an excellent inference, if I ſhould conclude now as you do; That you forſake the formal motive of Faith, which is Gods Revelation, and conſequently loſe all faith and unity therein? So likewiſe the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> and <hi>Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans,</hi> the <hi>Franciſcans</hi> and <hi>Dominicans</hi> diſagree about things
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:57896:90"/>equally revealed by Almighty God: and ſeeing they do ſo, I beſeech you let me underſtand, why this reaſon will not exclude them as well as Proteſtants <hi>from all faith and unity therein?</hi> Thus you have failed of your undertaking in your firſt part of your Title, and that is a very ill <hi>omen,</hi> eſpecially in points of ſo ſtreight mutual dependance, that we ſhall have but ſlender performance in your ſecond aſſumpt. Which is, <hi>That the Church is Infallible in all her Definitions, whether concerning points Fundamental, or not Fundamental.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="26">26. Ad §. 9.10, 11. I grant that the Church <hi>cannot with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out damnable ſin, either deny any thing to be true, which ſhe knows to be Gods truth:</hi> or propoſe <hi>any thing as his truth, which ſhe knows not to be ſo.</hi> But that ſhe may not do this by ignorance or miſtake, and ſo without damnable ſin, that you ſhould have proved, but have not. But, ſay you <hi>this excuſe cannot ſerve: for if the Church be aſſiſted only for points fundamental, ſhe cannot but know that ſhe may err in points not fundamental.</hi> Anſ. It does not follow, unleſs you ſuppoſe, that the Church knows that ſhe is aſſiſted no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But if, being aſſiſted only ſo far, ſhe yet did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive by error her aſſiſtance abſolute and unlimited, or if knowing her aſſiſtance reſtrained to fundamentals, ſhe yet conceived by error, that ſhe ſhould be guarded, from propoſing any thing but what was fundamental, then the conſequence is apparently falſe. <hi>But at leaſt ſhe cannot be certain that ſhe cannot err, and therefore cannot be excuſed from headlong and pernicious temerity in propoſing points not funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental, to be believed by Chriſtians as matters of Faith.</hi> Anſ. Neither is this deſtruction worth any thing; unleſs it be underſtood of ſuch fundamental points, as ſhe is not war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted to propoſe by evident Text of Scripture. Indeed if ſhe propoſe ſuch, as <hi>matters of Faith certainly true,</hi> ſhe may well be queſtioned, <hi>Quo Warranto?</hi> She builds with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a foundation, and <hi>ſays thus ſaith the Lord, when the Lord doth not ſay ſo:</hi> which cannot be excuſed from raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and high preſumption; ſuch a preſumption, as an Embaſſador ſhould commit, who ſhould ſay in his Maſters name that for which he hath no commiſſion. Of the ſame
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:57896:91"/>nature, I ſay, but of a higher ſtrain: as much as the King of Heaven, is greater than any earthly King. But though ſhe may err in ſome points not fundamental, yet may ſhe have certainty enough in propoſing others; as for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, theſe, <hi>That Abraham begat Iſaac,</hi> that S. <hi>Paul had a Cloak,</hi> that <hi>Timothy was ſick;</hi> becauſe theſe, though not fundamental, <hi>i. e.</hi> no eſſential parts of Chriſtianity, yet are evidently, and undeniably ſet down in Scripture, and conſequently, may be without all raſhneſs propoſed by the Church as certain divine Revelations. Neither is your Argument concluding when you ſay, <hi>If in ſuch things ſhe may be deceived, ſhe muſt be always uncertain of all ſuch things.</hi> For my ſenſe may ſometimes poſſibly deceive me, yet I am certain enough that I ſee what I ſee, and feel what I feel. Our Judges are not infallible in their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, yet are they certain enough, that they judge aright, and that they proceed according to the evidence that is given, when they condemn a Thief, or a Murderer to the Gallows. A Travelleris not always certain of his way, but often miſtaken; and does it therefore follow that he can have no aſſurance that <hi>Charing-Croſs</hi> is his right way from the <hi>Temple</hi> to <hi>White-Hall?</hi> The ground of your error here, is your not diſtinguiſhing, between actual certainty and abſolute infallibillty. Geometricians are not infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in their own Science: yet they are very certain of thoſe things, which they ſee demonſtrated. And Carpenters are not infallible, yet certain of the ſtraightneſs of thoſe things which agree with their Rule and Square. So though the Church be not infallibly certain, that in all her defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, whereof ſome are about diſputable and ambiguous matters, ſhe ſhall proceed according to her Rule, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing certain of the infallibility of her Rule, and that in this or that thing ſhe doth manifeſtly proceed according to it, ſhe may be certain of the Truth of ſome particular De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees, and yet not certain that ſhe ſhall never decree but what is true.</p>
                     <p n="27">27. Ad §. 12. Obj. <hi>But if the Church may err in points not fundamental, ſhe may err in propoſing Scripture, and ſo we cannot be aſſured whether ſhe have not been deceived already.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="173" facs="tcp:57896:91"/>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> The Church may err in her propoſition or cuſtody of the Canon of Scripture, if you underſtand by the Church, any preſent Church of one denomination, for example, the <hi>Roman,</hi> the <hi>Greek,</hi> or ſo. Yet have we ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient certainty of Scripture, not from the bare teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of any preſent Church, but from Univerſal Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, of which the teſtimony of any preſent Church is but a little part. So that here you fall into the Fallacy, <hi>à dicto ſecundum quid ad dictum ſimpliciter.</hi> For in effect this is the ſenſe of your Argument: Unleſs the Church be infallible, we can have no certainty of Scripture from the authority of the Church: Therefore unleſs the Church be infallible, we can have no certainty hereof at all. As if a man ſhould ſay; If the Vintage of <hi>France</hi> miſcarry, we can have no Wine from <hi>France:</hi> Therefore if that Vintage miſcarry we can have no Wine at all. And for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruption of Scripture, I know no other rational aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance we can have of it, than ſuch as we have of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruption of other ancient Books, that is, the conſent of ancient Copies: ſuch I mean <hi>for the kind,</hi> though it be far <hi>greater for the degree of it.</hi> And if the Spirit of God give any man any other aſſurance hereof, this is not rational and diſcurſive, but ſupernatural and infuſed. An aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance it may be to himſelf, but no argument to another. As for the Infallibility of the Church, it is ſo far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a proof of the Scriptures incorruption, that no proof can be pretended for it, but incorrupted places of Scripture: which yet are as ſubject to corruption as any other, and more likely to have been corrupted (if it had been poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) than any other, and made to ſpeak as they do, for the advantage of thoſe men, whoſe ambition it hath been a long time, to bring all under their authority. Now then, if any man ſhould prove the Scriptures uncorrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, becauſe the Church ſays ſo which is infallible: I would demand again touching this very thing, that there is an infallible Church, ſeeing it is not of it ſelf evident, how ſhall I be aſſured of it? And what can he anſwer, but that the Scripture ſays ſo in theſe and theſe places? Hereupon I would ask him, how ſhall I be aſſured, that the Scriptures
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:57896:92"/>are incorrupted in thoſe places? ſeeing it is poſſible, and not altogether improbable, that theſe men, which deſire to be thought infallible, when they had the government of all things in their own hands, may have altered them for their purpoſe. If to this he anſwer again, that the Church is infallible, and therefore cannot do ſo. I hope it would be apparent, that he runs round in a circle, and proves the Scriptures incorruption, by the Churches infallibility, and the Churches infallibility by the Scriptures incorrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that is in effect the Churches infallibility, by the Churches infallibility, and the Scriptures incorruption by the Scriptures incorruption.</p>
                     <p n="28">28. Now for your obſervation, that <hi>ſome Books, which were not always known to be Canonical, have been afterwards received for ſuch. But never any book or ſyllable defined for Canonical, was afterwards queſtioned or rejected for Apocryphal:</hi> I demand, touching the firſt ſort, whether they were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to the Church by the Apoſtles as Canonical or not? If not, ſeeing the whole Faith was preached by the Apoſtles to the Church, and ſeeing after the Apoſtles, the Church pretends to no new Revelations, how can it be an Article of Faith to believe them Canonical? And how can you pretend, that your Church which makes this an Article of Faith, is ſo aſſiſted as not to propoſe any thing as a divine Truth which is not revealed by God? If they were, how then is the Church an infallible keeper of the Canon of Scripture, which hath ſuffered ſome Books of Canonical Scripture, to be loſt? and others to loſe for a long time their being Canonical, at leaſt, the neceſſity of being ſo eſteemed, and afterwards, as it were by the law of <hi>Poſtliminium</hi> hath reſtored their Authority and Canonicalneſs unto them? If this was delivered by the Apoſtles to the Church, the point was ſufficiently diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and therefore your Churches omiſſion to teach it for ſome ages, as an article of faith, nay degrading it from the number of articles of faith, and putting it among diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble problems, was ſurely not very laudable. If it were not revealed by God to the Apoſtles, and by the Apoſtles to the Church, then can it be no Revelation, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:57896:92"/>her preſumption in propoſing it as ſuch, is inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable.</p>
                     <p n="29">29. And then for the other part of it, <hi>that never any book or ſyllable defined for Canonical, was afterwards queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned or rejected for Apocryphal:</hi> Certainly it is a bold aſſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, but extreamly falſe. For I demand; The Book of <hi>Eccleſiaſticus</hi> and <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> the <hi>Epiſtle of</hi> S. <hi>James,</hi> and <hi>to the Hebrews,</hi> were they by the Apoſtles approved for Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, or no? If not, with what face dare you approve them, and yet pretend that all your doctrin is Apoſtolical? Eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſeeing it is evident that this point is not deducible by rational diſcourſe from any other defined by them. If they were approved by them, this I hope was a ſufficient definition: and therefore you were beſt rub your forehead hard, and ſay, that theſe Books were never queſtioned. But if you do ſo, then I ſhall be bold to ask you, what Books you meant in ſaying before, <hi>Some Books which were not always known to be Canonical, have been afterwards re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived?</hi> Then for the Book of <hi>Macchabes,</hi> I hope you will ſay, it was defined for Canonical before S. <hi>Gregories</hi> time: and yet he, lib. 19. Moral, c. 13. citing a teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny out of it, prefaceth to it after this matter, <hi>Concerning which matter we do not amiſs if we produce a teſtimony out of Books although not Canonical, yet ſet forth, for the edification of the Church. For Eleazar in the Book of Machabees,</hi> &amp;c. Which if it be not to reject it from being Canonical, is without queſtion, at leaſt to queſtion it. Moreover, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you are ſo punctual, as to talk of words and ſyllables, I would know whether before <hi>Sixtus Quintus</hi> his time, your Church had a defined Canon of Scripture, or not? If not, then was your Church ſurely a moſt vigilant keeper of Scripture, that for 1500. years had not defined what was Scripture, and what was not. If it had, then I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, was it <hi>that,</hi> ſet forth by <hi>Sixtus,</hi> or <hi>that,</hi> ſet forth by <hi>Clement,</hi> or a <hi>third</hi> different from both? If it were that ſet forth by <hi>Sixtus,</hi> then is it now condemned by <hi>Clement:</hi> if that of <hi>Clement,</hi> it was condemned I ſay, but ſure you will ſay contradicted and queſtioned by <hi>Sixtus;</hi> If diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from both, then was it queſtioned and condemned
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:57896:93"/>by both, and ſtill lies under the condemnation. But then laſtly, ſuppoſe it had been true, <hi>That both ſome Book not known to be Canonical had been received,</hi> and that <hi>never any after receiving had been queſtioned:</hi> How had this been a ſign that the Church is infallibly aſſiſted by the Holy Ghoſt? In what mood or figure, would this concluſion follow out of theſe Premiſes? Certainly your flying to ſuch poor ſigns, as theſe are, is to me a great ſign, that you labour with penury of better arguments: and that, thus to catch at ſhadows and bulruſhes, is a ſhrewd ſign of a ſinking cauſe.</p>
                     <p n="30">30. Ad §. 13. We are told here, <hi>That the general pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of Infallibility to the Church, muſt not be reſtrained only to points fundamental: Becauſe then the Apoſtles words and writings may alſo be ſo reſtrained.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> This alſo may be done, but if it be done, may eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be confuted. It is done to our hand in this very Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph, by five words taken out of Scripture, <hi>All Scripture is divinely inſpired.</hi> Shew but as much for the Church: Shew where it is written, <hi>That all the decrees of the Church are divinely inſpired;</hi> and the Controverſie will be at an end. Beſides, there is not the ſame reaſon for the Churches abſolute Infallibility, as for the Apoſtles and Scriptures. For if the Church fall into error, it may be reformed by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring it with the rule of the Apoſtles doctrine and Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture. But if the Apoſtles have erred in delivering the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Chriſtianity, to whom ſhall we have recourſe, for the diſcovering and correcting their error? Again, there is not ſo much ſtrength required in the Edifice as in the Foundation: and if but wiſe men have the ordering of the building, they will make it much a ſurer thing, that the foundation ſhall not fail the building, than that the building ſhall not fall from the foundation. And though the building be to be of Brick or Stone, and perhaps of Wood, yet if it may be poſſibly, they will have a Rock for their foundation, whoſe ſtability is a much more indubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table thing, than the adherence of the ſtructure to it. Now the Apoſtles and Prophets, and Canonical Writers, are the foundation of the Church, according to that of S. <hi>Paul,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:57896:93"/>built upon the foundation of Apoſtles and Prophets;</hi> therefore their ſtability, in reaſon ought to be greater than the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, which is built upon them. Again, a dependent In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility (eſpecially if the dependence be voluntary) can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſo certain, as that on which it depends: But the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility of the Church, depends upon the Infallibility of the Apoſtles, and the ſtreightneſs of the thing regulated, upon the ſtreightneſs of the Rule: and beſides this depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is voluntary, for it is in the power of the Church to deviate from this Rule; being nothing elſe but an aggre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of men, of which every one has free will, and is ſubject to paſſions and error: Therefore the Churehes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility, is not ſo certain as that of the Apoſtles.</p>
                     <p n="31">31. Laſtly, <hi>Quid verba audiam, cum facta videam?</hi> If you be ſo infallible as the Apoſtles were, ſhew it as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles did; <hi>They went forth</hi> (ſaith S. <hi>Mark</hi>) <hi>and Preached every where, the Lord working with them, and confirming their words with Signs following.</hi> It is impoſſible that God ſhould lie, and that the eternal Truth ſhould ſet his hand and ſeal to the confirmation of a falſhood, or of ſuch Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin as is partly true and partly falſe. The Apoſtles Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin was thus confirmed, therefore it was intirely true, and in no part either falſe or uncertain. I ſay in no part of that which they delivered conſtantly, as a certain divine Truth, and which had the Atteſtation of Divine Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. For that the Apoſtles themſelves, even after the ſending of the Holy Ghoſt, were, and through inadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence or prejudice, continued for a time in an error, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to a revealed Truth, it is as I have already noted unanſwerably evident, from the <hi>ſtory of the Acts of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles.</hi> For notwithſtanding our Saviours expreſs warrant and injunction, <hi>to go and preach to all Nations,</hi> yet until S. <hi>Peter</hi> was better informed by a viſion from Heaven, and by the converſion of <hi>Cornelius,</hi> both he and the reſt of the Church, held it unlawful for them, to go or preach the Goſpel to any but the Jews.</p>
                     <p n="32">32. And for thoſe things which they profeſs to deliver as the dictates of human reaſon and prudence, and not as divine Revelations, why we ſhould take them to be divine
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:57896:94"/>revelations, I ſee no reaſon; nor how we can do ſo, and not contradict the Apoſtles, and God himſelf. Therefore when S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, in the firſt Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinth.</hi> 7.12. <hi>To the reſt ſpeak I, not the Lord;</hi> And again, <hi>concerning Virgins I have no commandment of the Lord, but I deliver my Judgment:</hi> If we will pretend, that the Lord did certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpeak, what S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpake, and that his judgment was Gods commandment, ſhall we not plainly contradict S. <hi>Paul,</hi> and that ſpirit by which he wrote? which moved him to Write, as in other places divine Revelations, which he certainly knew to be ſuch, ſo in this place, his own judgment, touching ſome things which God had not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly revealed unto him.</p>
                     <p n="34">34. Obj. <hi>But if the Apoſtles were Infallible, in all things propoſed by them as divine Truths, the like muſt be affirmed of the Church, becauſe</hi> Proteſtants <hi>teach the promiſe (of leading into all Truth) to be verified in the Church.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> It's true that to the Apoſtles the promiſe was made, and to them only, yet the words are true alſo of the Church. But they agree to the Apoſtles <hi>in a higher,</hi> to the Church <hi>in a lower</hi> ſenſe: to the Apoſtles <hi>in more abſolute,</hi> to the Church in <hi>a more limited</hi> ſenſe. To the Apoſtles <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely,</hi> for the <hi>Churches direction:</hi> to the Church <hi>Conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally by adherence to that direction, and ſo far as ſhe doth ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to it.</hi> In a word, the Apoſtles were led into all Truths by the Spirit, <hi>efficaciter:</hi> The Church is led alſo into all Truth by the Apoſtles <hi>writings, ſufficienter.</hi> So that the Apoſtles and the Church, may be fitly compared to the Star and the Wiſemen. The Star was directed by the finger of God, and could not but go right to the place where Chriſt was: But the Wiſemen were led by the Star to Chriſt; led by it, I ſay, not <hi>efficaciter,</hi> or <hi>irreſiſtibiliter,</hi> but <hi>ſufficienter,</hi> ſo that if they would they might follow it, if they would not, they might chooſe. So was it between the Apoſtles writing Scriptures, and the Church. They in their writing were infallibly aſſiſted to propoſe nothing as a divine Truth, but what was ſo. The Church is alſo led into all Truth, but it is by the intervening of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles writings: But it is, as the Wiſemen were led by the
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:57896:94"/>Star, or as a Traveller is directed by a Mercurial Statue, or as a Pilot by his Card and Compaſs: led ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but not irreſiſtibly: led ſo that ſhe may follow, not ſo that ſhe muſt. For ſeeing the Church is a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of men, whereof every one (according to the Doctrine of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church) hath free-will in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, it follows, that the whole aggregate has free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will in believing. And if any man ſay that at leaſt <hi>it is morally impoſſible, that of ſo many whereof all may believe aright, not any ſhould do ſo:</hi> I anſwer, It is true, if they did all give themſelves any liberty of judgment. But if all (as the caſe is here) captivate their underſtandings to one of them, all are as likely to err as that one. And he more likely to err than any other, becauſe he may err and thinks he cannot, and becauſe he conceives the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit abſolutely promiſed to the ſucceſſion of Biſhops, of which many have been notoriouſly and confeſſedly wicked men, <hi>Men of the World:</hi> whereas this Spirit is the <hi>Spirit of Truth, whom the world cannot receive, becauſe he ſeeth him not, neither knoweth him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="38">38. Ad §. 16. To this Paragraph, which pretends to ſhew, <hi>that if the Catholick Church be fallible in ſome points, it follows, that no true Proteſtant can with aſſurance believe the Univerſal Church in any one point of Doctrin.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Though the Church being not Infallible, I cannot believe her in every thing ſhe ſays, yet I can and muſt believe her in every thing ſhe proves, either by Scripture, Reaſon, or Univerſal Tradition, be it Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental, or be it not Fundamental. This you ſay, we <hi>can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, in points not Fundamental, becauſe in ſuch we believe ſhe may err.</hi> But this I know, we can: becauſe though ſhe may err in ſome things, yet ſhe does not err in what ſhe proves, though it be not Fundamental. Again you ſay, <hi>we cannot do it in Fundamentals, becauſe we muſt know what points be Fundamental, before we go to learn of her.</hi> Not ſo, but I muſt learn of the Church, or of ſome part of the Church, or I cannot know any thing Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal or not Fundamental. For how can I come to know, that there was ſuch a Man as Chriſt, that he taught ſuch
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:57896:95"/>Doctrin, that he and his Apoſtles did ſuch miracles in confirmation of it, that the Scripture is Gods Word, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs I be taught it. So then the Church is, though <hi>not a certain Foundation and proof of my Faith, yet a neceſſary intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction to it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="39">39. But the <hi>Churches infallible direction, extending only to Fundamentals, unleſs I know them before I go to learn of her, I may be rather deluded than inſtructed by her.</hi> The reaſon and connexion of this conſequence, I fear neither I nor you do well underſtand. And beſides I muſt tell you, you are too bold in taking that which no man grants you, <hi>that the Church is an infallible directer in Fundamentals.</hi> For if ſhe were ſo, then muſt we not only learn Fundamentals of her, but alſo <hi>learn of her what is fundamental, and take all for fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental which ſhe delivers to be ſuch.</hi> In the performance whereof, if I knew any one Church to be infallible, I would quickly be of that Church. But good Sir, you muſt needs do us this favor, to be ſo acute, as to diſtinguiſh between, being <hi>infallible in fundamentals,</hi> and being an <hi>infallible guide in fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals.</hi> That there ſhall be always <hi>a Church infallible in fundamentals,</hi> we eaſily grant; for it comes to no more but this, <hi>that there ſhall be always a Church.</hi> But that there ſhall be always ſuch a Church, which is an infallible Guide in fundamentals, this we deny. For this cannot be without ſetling a known infallibility in ſome one known ſociety of Chriſtians, (as the <hi>Greek</hi> or the <hi>Roman,</hi> or ſome other Church) by adhering to which Guide, men might be gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to believe aright in all Fundamentals. A man that were deſtitute of all means of communicating his thoughts to others, might yet in himſelf, and to himſelf be infallible, but he could not be a Guide to others. A man or a Church that were inviſible, ſo that none could know how to repair to it for direction, could not be an infallible guide, and yet he might be in himſelf infallible. You ſee then there is a wide difference between theſe two, and therefore I muſt beſeech you not to confound them, nor to take the one for the other.</p>
                     <p n="40">40. But they that <hi>know what points are Fundamental, otherwiſe than by the Churches authority, learn not of the Church:</hi>
                        <pb n="181" facs="tcp:57896:95"/>Yes, they may learn of the Church, that the Scripture is the word of God, and from the Scripture, that ſuch points are fundamental, others are not ſo; and conſequently learn, even of the Church, even of your Church, that all is not fundamental, nay all is not true, which the Church teacheth to be ſo. Neither do I ſee what hinders, but a man may learn of a Church, how to confute the Errors of that Church which taught him: as well as of my Maſter in Phyſick, or the Mathematicks, I may learn thoſe rules and principles, by which I may confute my Maſters erroneous concluſions.</p>
                     <p n="41">41. But you ask, <hi>If the Church be not an infallible teacher, why are we commanded to hear, to ſeek, to obey the Church?</hi> I Anſwer. For commands <hi>to ſeek the Church,</hi> I have not yet met with any, and I believe you, if you were to ſhew them, would be your ſelf to ſeek. But yet if you could produce ſome ſuch, we might ſeek the Church to many good purpoſes, without ſuppoſing her <hi>a Guide infallible.</hi> And then for <hi>hearing and obeying the Church,</hi> I would fain know, whether none may be heard and obeyed, but thoſe that are infallible? Whether particular Churches, Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors, Paſtors, Parents, be not to be heard and obeyed? Or whether all theſe be Infallible? I wonder you will thruſt upon us ſo often, theſe worn-out Objections, without taking notice of their Anſwers.</p>
                     <p n="42">42. Your Argument from S. <hi>Auſtine</hi>'s firſt place, is a fallacy, <hi>A dicto ſecundum quid ad dictum ſimpliciter.</hi> If the <hi>whole Church practiſe any of theſe things (matters of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and decency,</hi> for ſuch only there he ſpeaks of,) <hi>to diſpute whether that ought to be done, is inſolent madneſs.</hi> And from hence you infer, <hi>If the whole Church practiſe any thing, to diſpute whether it ought to be done, is inſolent madneſs.</hi> As if there were no difference between <hi>any thing, and any of theſe things?</hi> Or as if I might not eſteem it pride and folly, to contradict and diſturb the Church for matter of order, pertaining to the time and place, and other circumſtances of Gods worſhip; and yet account it neither pride nor folly, to go about to reform ſome errors, which the Church hath ſuffered to come in, and to vitiate the very
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:57896:96"/>ſubſtance of Gods worſhip. It was a practice of the whole Church in Saint <hi>Auſtines</hi> time, and eſteemed an Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Tradition, even by Saint <hi>Auſtine</hi> himſelf, <hi>That the Euchariſt ſhould be adminiſtred to Infants:</hi> Tell me Sir, I beſeech you; Had it been inſolent madneſs to diſpute againſt this practice, or had it not? If it had, how inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and mad are you, that have not only diſputed againſt it, but utterly aboliſhed it? If it had not, then as I ſay, you muſt underſtand Saint <hi>Auſtines</hi> words, not ſimply of all things, but (as indeed he himſelf reſtrained them) <hi>of theſe things, of matter of Order, Decency, and Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="44">44. Obj. But the Doctrines, that <hi>Infants are to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, and thoſe that are baptized by Hereticks, are not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptized, are neither of them to be proved by Scripture: And yet according to</hi> S. <hi>Auſtine they are true Doctrins, and we may be certain of them upon the Authority of the Church, which we could not be, unleſs the Church were Infallible; therefore the Clurch is Infallible.</hi> I anſwer, that there is no repugnance but we may be certain enough, of the Univerſal Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the ancient Church, ſuch as in S. <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, theſe were which here are ſpoken of, and yet not be certain enough, of the definitions of the preſent Church. Unleſs you can ſhew (which I am ſure you can never do) that the Infallibility of the preſent Church, was always a Tradition of the ancient Church. Now your main bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs is to prove the preſent Church Infallible, not ſo much in conſigning ancient Traditions, as in defining emergent controverſies. Again, it follows not, becauſe the Churches Authority, is warrant enough for us to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve ſome Doctrin, touching which the Scripture is ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, therefore it is Warrant enough to believe theſe, to which the Scripture ſeems repugnant. Now the Doctrins which S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> received upon the Churches Authority, were of the firſt ſort; the Doctrins for which we deny your Churches Infallibility are of the ſecond. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore though the Churches Authority, might be ſtrong enough, to bear the weight which S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> laid upon it, yet happily it may not be ſtrong enough, to bear that
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:57896:96"/>which you lay upon it. Though it may ſupport ſome Doctrines without Scripture, yet ſurely not againſt it. And laſt of all, to deal ingeniouſly with you and the world, I am not ſuch an Idolater of S. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> as to think a thing proved ſufficiently becauſe he ſays it, nor that all his ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences are Oracles; and particularly in this thing, that whatſoever was practiſed or held by the Univerſal Church of his time, muſt needs have come from the Apoſtles. Though conſidering the nearneſs of his time to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, I think it a good probable way, and therefore am apt enough to follow it, when I ſee no reaſon to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. Yet I profeſs I muſt have better ſatisfaction, before I can induce my ſelf to hold it certain and infallible. And this, not becauſe <hi>Popery</hi> would come in at this door, as ſome have vainly feared, but becauſe by the Church U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal of ſome time, and the Church Univerſal of other times, I ſee plain contradictions held and practiſed. Both which could not come from the Apoſtles, for then the Apoſtles had been teachers of falſehood. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the belief or practice of the preſent Univerſal Church, can be no infallible proof, that the Doctrin ſo believed, or the cuſtom ſo practiſed came from the Apoſtles. I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in the Doctrine of the <hi>Millenaries,</hi> and the <hi>Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſts neceſſity for Infants:</hi> both which Doctrines have been taught by the conſent of the eminent Fathers of ſome ages, without any oppoſition from any of their Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poraries: and were delivered by them, not as Doctors, but as Witneſſes, not as their own Opinions, but as Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolick Traditions. And therefore meaſuring the Doctrin of the Church by all the Rules which Cardinal <hi>Perron</hi> gives us for that purpoſe, both theſe Doctrines muſt be acknowledged to have been the Doctrines of the Ancient Church of ſome age, or ages; And that the contrary Doctrines were Catholick at ſome other time, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve you will not think it needful for me to prove. So that either I muſt ſay, the Apoſtles were fountains of contradictious Doctrines, or that being the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Doctrine of the preſent Church, is no ſufficient proof that it came originally from the Apoſtles. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:57896:97"/>who can warrant us, that the Univerſal Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Church were all Apoſtolical? ſeeing in that famous place for Traditions, in <hi>Tertullian,

But let us ſee what S. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> ſays, <hi>They (the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles) delivered not all things in writing</hi> (who denies it?) <hi>but many things alſo without writing,</hi> (who doubts of it?) <hi>and theſe alſo are worthy of belief.</hi> Yes, if we knew what they were. But many things are worthy of belief, which are not neceſſary to be believed: As that <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> was Emperor of <hi>Rome</hi> is a thing worthy of belief, being ſo well teſtified as it is, but yet it is not neceſſary to be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; a man may be ſaved without it. Thoſe many works which <hi>our Saviour did (which S.</hi> John <hi>ſuppoſes, would not
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:57896:97"/>have been contained in a World of Books</hi>) if they had been written, or if God by ſome other means had preſerved the knowledge of them, had been as worthy to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, and as neceſſary as thoſe that are written. But to ſhew you how much a more faithful keeper Records are than report, thoſe few that were written are preſerved and believed, thoſe infinity more that were not written, are all loſt and vaniſhed out of the memory of men. And ſeeing God in his providence, hath not thought fit to preſerve the memory of them, he hath freed us from the obligation of believing them: for every obligation ceaſes, when it becomes impoſſible. Who can doubt but the Primitive Chriſtians, to whom the Epiſtles of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles were written, either of themſelves underſtood, or were inſtructed by the Apoſtles, touching the ſenſe of the obſcure places of them? Theſe Traditive interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, had they been written and diſperſed, as the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures were, had without queſtion been preſerved, as the Scriptures are. But to ſhew how excellent a Keeper of the Tradition, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath been, or even the Catholick Church, for want of writing they are all loſt, nay were all loſt, within a few Ages after Chriſt. So that if we conſult the Ancient Interpreters, we ſhall hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly find any two of them agree about the ſenſe of any one of them. <hi>Cardinal Perron,</hi> in his diſcourſe of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, having alledged this place for them, <hi>Hold the Traditions,</hi> &amp;c. tell us we <hi>muſt not anſwer, that S.</hi> Paul <hi>ſpeaks here, only of ſuch Traditions, which (though not in this Epiſt. to the</hi> Theſſalonians) <hi>yet were afterwards witten, and in other Books of Scripture: becauſe it is upon occaſion of Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> (touching the <hi>cauſe</hi> of the <hi>hinderance of the coming of</hi> Antichriſt,) <hi>which was never written, that he lays this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction upon them, to hold the Traditions.</hi> Well, let us grant this Argument good, and concluding; and that the Church of the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> or the Catholick Church (for what S. <hi>Paul</hi> writ to one Church he writ to all,) were to hold ſome unwritten Traditions, and among the reſt, what was the cauſe of the hinderance of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Antichriſt.</hi> But what if they did not perform
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:57896:98"/>their duty in this point, but ſuffered this Tradition to be loſt out of the memory of the Church? Shall we not conclude, that ſeeing God would not ſuffer any thing neceſſary to Salvation to be loſt, and he has ſuffered this Tradition to be loſt, therefore the knowledge or belief of it, though it were a profitable thing, yet it was not neceſſary? I hope you will not challenge ſuch authority over us, as to oblige us to impoſſibilities, to do that which you cannot do your ſelves. It is therefore requiſite that you make this command poſſible to be obeyed, before you require obedience unto it. Are you able then to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct us ſo well, as to be fit to ſay unto us, <hi>Now ye know what withholdeth?</hi> Or do you your ſelves know that ye may inſtruct us? Can ye, or dare you ſay, this or this was this hindrance which S. <hi>Paul</hi> here meant, and all men under pain of damnation are to believe it? Or if you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, (as I am certain you cannot) go then, and Vaunt your Church, for the only Watchful, Faithful, Infallible Keeper of the Apoſtles Traditions; when here this very Tradition, which here in particular was depoſited with the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> and the Premitive Church, you have utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly loſt it, ſo that there is no Footſtep or print of it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining, which with Divine Faith we may rely upon. Bleſſed therefore be the goodneſs of God, who ſeeing that what was not written, was in ſuch danger to be loſt, took order, that what was neceſſary ſhould be written! S. <hi>Chryſoſtoms</hi> counſel therefore, of <hi>accounting the Churches Traditions worthy of belief,</hi> we are willing to obey: And if you can of any thing make it appear, that <hi>it is Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> we will ſeek no farther. But this we ſay withal, that we are perſuaded we cannot make this appear in any thing, but <hi>only the Canon of Scripture,</hi> and that there is nothing now extant, and to be known by us, which can put in ſo good Plea, to be the unwritten Word of God, as the unqueſtioned Books of Canonical Scripture, to be the written Word of God.</p>
                     <p n="47">47. You conclude this Paragraph with a ſentence of S. <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s who ſays, <hi>The Church doth not approve, nor diſſemble, nor do theſe things which are againſt Faith
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:57896:98"/>or good Life:</hi> and from hence you conclude, <hi>that it never hath done ſo, nor never can do ſo.</hi> But though the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hold in Logick <hi>à non poſſe, ad non eſſe,</hi> yet I never heard, that it would hold back again, <hi>à non eſse, ad non poſſe.</hi> The Church cannot do this, therefore it does it not, follows with good conſequence: but the Church does not this, therefore it ſhall never do it, nor can never do it, this I believe will hardly follow. In the Epiſtle next before to the ſame <hi>Januarius,</hi> writing of the ſame matter, he hath theſe words, <hi>It remains that the thing you inquire of, muſt be of that third kind of things, which are different in divers places. Let every one therefore do, that which he finds done in the Church to which he comes, for none of them is againſt Faith or good manners.</hi> And why do you not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from hence, that <hi>no particular Church can bring up any Cuſtom that is againſt Faith or good manners?</hi> Certainly this conſequence has as good reaſon for it as the former. If a man ſay of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> (what S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> of the Church) that ſhe neither approves, nor diſſembles, nor does any thing againſt Faith or good manners, would you collect preſently, that this man did either make or think the Church of <hi>England</hi> infallible? Furthermore, it is obſervable out of this, and the former Epiſtle, that this Church <hi>which did not</hi> (as S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> according to you, thought) <hi>approve or diſſemble, or do any thing againſt Faith or good Life,</hi> did yet tolerate and diſſemble vain ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and humane preſumptions, and ſuffer all places to be full of them, and to be exacted, as, nay more ſeverely than the commandments of God himſelf. This S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> himſelf profeſſeth in this very Epiſtle. <hi>This</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I do infinitely grieve at, that many moſt wholeſom precepts of the Divine Scripture, are little regarded; and in the mean time, all is ſo full of ſo many preſumptions, that he is more grievouſly found fault with, who during his octaves, toucheth the Earth with his naked Foot, than he that ſhall bury his Soul in Drunkenneſs.</hi> Of theſe he ſays, <hi>that they were neither contained in Scripture, decreed by Councils, nor corroborated by the Cuſtom of the Univerſal Church.</hi> And <hi>though not againſt Faith, yet unprofitable burdens of Chriſtian Liberty, which
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:57896:99"/>made the condition of the</hi> Jews <hi>more tolerable than that of Chriſtians.</hi> And therefore he profeſſes of them, <hi>Approbare non poſſum, I cannot approve them.</hi> And <hi>ubi facultas tribuitur, reſecanda exiſtimo, I think they are to be cut off, whereſoever we have power.</hi> Yet ſo deeply were they rooted, and ſpread ſo far, through the indiſcreet devotion of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, always more prone to ſuperſtion than true Piety, and through the connivence of the Governors, who ſhould have ſtrangled them at their Birth, that himſelf, though he grieved at them, and could not allow them, yet for fear of offence he durſt not ſpeak againſt them, <hi>multa hujuſmodi propter nonnullarum vel ſanctarum vel turbulenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum perſonarum ſcandala devitanda liberius improbare non audeo. Many of theſe things for fear of ſcandalizing many holy perſons, or provoking thoſe that are turbulent, I dare not freely diſallow.</hi> Nay, the Catholick Church it ſelf, did ſee and diſſemble, and tolerate them; for theſe are the things of which he preſently ſays after, <hi>the Church of God</hi> (and you will have him ſpeak of the true Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church) <hi>placed between Chaffe and Tares, tolerates ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things.</hi> Which was directly againſt the command of the Holy Spirit, given the Church by S. <hi>Paul; To ſtand faſt in that liberty wherewith Chriſt hath made her free, and not to ſuffer her ſelf to be brought in bondage to theſe ſurvile burdens.</hi> Our Saviour tells the Scribes and Phariſees, <hi>that in vain they Worſhiped God, teaching for Doctrines mens Commandments: For that laying aſide the Commandments of God, they held the Traditions of men, as the waſhing of Pots, and Cups, and many other ſuch like things.</hi> Certainly that which S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> complains of, as the general fault of Chriſtians of his time, was parallel to this: <hi>Multa</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>quae in divinis libris ſaluberrima praecepta ſunt, minus curantur;</hi> This I ſuppoſe I may very well render in our Saviours Words, <hi>The commandments of God are laid aſide;</hi> and then; <hi>tam multis preſumptionibus ſic plena ſunt omnia, all things, or all places, are ſo full of ſo many preſumptions, and thoſe exacted with ſuch ſeverity, nay with Tyranny, that he was more ſeverely cenſured, who in the time of his Octaves touched the Earth with his naked Feet, than he which drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:57896:99"/>and buried his Soul in Drink.</hi> Certainly, if this be not <hi>to teach for Doctrines mens Commandments,</hi> I know not what is. And therefore theſe ſuperſtitious Chriſtians might be ſaid, <hi>to Worſhip God in vain,</hi> as well as Scribes and Phariſees. And yet great variety of ſuperſtitions of this kind, were then already ſpread over the Church, being different in divers place. This is plain from theſe Words of S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> of them, <hi>diverſorum locorum diverſis moribus innumerabiliter variantur;</hi> and apparent, becauſe the ſtream of them was grown ſo violent, that he durſt not oppoſe it, <hi>liberiùs improbare non audeo, I dare not freely ſpeak againſt them.</hi> So that to ſay, the Catholick Church tolerated all this, and for fear of offence, durſt not abrogate or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn it, is to ſay (if we Judge rightly of it) that the Church with ſilence and connivence generally tolerated Chriſtians to <hi>worſhip God in vain.</hi> Now how this tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Univerſal ſuperſtition in the Church, can conſiſt with the aſſiſtance and direction of Gods omnipotent ſpirit to guard it from ſuperſtition, and with the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of that pretended Propheſie of the Church, I <hi>have ſet Watchmen upon thy Walls,</hi> O Jeruſalem, <hi>which ſhall never hold their peace Day nor Night;</hi> beſides how theſe ſuperſtitions being thus nouriſhed, cheriſhed, and ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the practice of the moſt, and urged with great violence upon others as the commandments of God, and but fearfully oppoſed or contradicted by any, might in time take ſuch deep Root, and ſpread their Branches ſo far, as to paſs for Univerſal Cuſtoms of the Church, he that does not ſee, ſees nothing. Eſpecially, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the catching and contagious nature of this ſin, and how faſt ill Weeds ſpread, and how true and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimented that rule is of the Hiſtorian, <hi>Exempla non con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſtunt ubi incipiunt, ſed quamlibet in tenuem recepta tramitem latiſſimè evagandi ſibi faciunt poteſtatem.</hi> Examples do not ſtay where they begin, but tho at firſt pent up in a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row Tract, they make themſelves room for extravagant wandrings. Nay that ſome ſuch ſuperſtition had not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready even in S. <hi>Auſtins</hi> time, prevailed ſo far, as to be <hi>Conſuetudine univerſae Eccleſiae roboratum,</hi> confirmed by the
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:57896:100"/>Cuſtom of the Univerſal Church, who can doubt that conſiders, that the practice of <hi>Commiunicating Infants,</hi> had even then got the credit, and authority, not only of an Univerſal Cuſtom, but alſo of an Apoſtolick Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
                     <p n="49">49. But now after all this ado, what if S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſays not this which is pretended of the Church, <hi>viz. That ſhe neither approves, nor diſſembles, nor practiſes any thing againſt Faith or good Life,</hi> but only of good men in the Church? Certainly, though ſome Copies read as you would have it, yet you ſhould not have diſſembled, that others read the place otherwiſe, <hi>vix. Eccleſia multa tolerat, &amp; tamen, quae ſunt contra Fidem &amp; bonam vitam, nec bonus approbat,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>The Church tolerates many things; and yet what is againſt Faith or good Life, a good man will neither approve, nor diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble, nor practiſe.</hi>

                     <p n="50">50. Ad §. 17. <hi>That</hi> Abraham <hi>begat Iſaacc,</hi> is a point very far from being Fundamental; and yet I hope you will grant, that <hi>Proteſtants</hi> believing Scripture to be the Word of God, may be certain enough of the truth and certainty of it. For what if they ſay <hi>that the Catholick Church, and much more themſelves may poſſibly Err in ſome unfundamental points,</hi> it is therefore conſequent, they can be certain of none ſuch? What if a wiſer man than I may miſtake the ſenſe of ſome obſcure place of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> may I not therefore without any arrogance or inconſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, conceive my ſelf certain that I underſtand him in ſome plain places, which carry their ſenſe before them? And then for points Fundamental, to what purpoſe do you ſay, <hi>That we muſt firſt know what they be, before we can be aſſured that we cannot Err in underſtanding the Scripture;</hi> when we pretend not at all to any aſſurance that we cannot Err, but only to a ſufficient certainty, that we do not Err, but rightly underſtand thoſe things that are plain, whether Fundamental or not Fundamental? That <hi>God is, and is a rewarder of them that ſeek him:</hi> That <hi>there is no Salvation but by Faith in Chriſt:</hi> That by <hi>repentance and Faith in Chriſt Remiſſion of ſins may be obtained:</hi> That <hi>there ſhall be a Reſurrection of the Body:</hi> Theſe we conceive both
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:57896:100"/>true, becauſe the Scripture ſays ſo, and Truths Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental; becauſe they are neceſſary parts of the Goſpel, whereof our Saviour ſaies, <hi>Qui non crediderit, damnabitur.</hi> All which we either learn from Scripture immediately, or learn of thoſe that learn it of Scripture, ſo that neither Learned nor Unlearned pretend to know theſe things independently of Scripture. And therefore in imputing this to us, you cannot excuſe your ſelf from having done us a palpable injury.</p>
                     <p n="52">52. Ad §. 19.] To that which is here urged of the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences amongſt <hi>Proteſtants</hi> concerning many points: I anſwer, that thoſe differences between <hi>Proteſtants</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Errors damnable and not damnable, Truths Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental and not Fundamental, may be eaſily reconciled. For either the Error they ſpeak of <hi>may be purely and ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply involuntary,</hi> or it may be in reſpect of the <hi>cauſe of it voluntary.</hi> If the cauſe of it be ſome voluntary and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable fault, the Error is it ſelf ſinful, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in its own nature damnable; As if by negligence in ſeeking the Truth, by unwillingneſs to find it, by Pride, by obſtinacy, by deſiring that Religion ſhould be true which ſutes beſt with my ends, by fear of mens ill opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, or any other worldly fear, or any other worldly hope, I betray my ſelf to any Error contrary to any Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine revealed Truth, that Error may be juſtly ſtiled a ſin, and conſequently of it ſelf to ſuch a one damnable. But if I be guilty of none of theſe faults, but be deſirous to know the Truth, and diligent in ſeeking it, and adviſe not at all with Fleſh and Blood about the choice of my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but only with God, and that Reaſon that he hath given me, if I be thus qualified, and yet through human infirmity fall into Error, that Error cannot be damnable. Again, the party erring may be conceived either to die with contrition for all his ſins known and unknown, or without it; If he die without it, this Error in it ſelf damnable, will be likewiſe ſo unto him: If he die with contrition (as his Error can be no impediment but he may) his Error though in it ſelf damnable, to him according to your Doctrine, will not prove ſo. And therefore ſome
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:57896:101"/>of thoſe Authors whom you quote, ſpeaking of Errors whereunto men were betrayed, or wherein they were kept by their Fault, or Vice, or Paſſion (as for the moſt part men are:) Others ſpeaking of them, as Errors ſimply and purely involuntary, and the effects of human infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity; ſome as they were <hi>retracted by Contrition</hi> (to uſe your own phraſe) others, as they were not; no marvel though they have paſt upon them, ſome a heavier, and ſome a milder, ſome an abſolving, and ſome a condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſentence. The leaſt of all theſe Errors, which here you mention, having malice enough too frequently mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with it, to ſink a man deep enough into Hell: and the greateſt of them all, being according to your Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, either no fault at all, or very Venial, where there is no malice of the will conjoyned with it. And if it be, yet as the moſt malignant poyſon, will not poyſon him that receives with it a more powerful Antidote: ſo I am confident your own Doctrine will force you to confeſs, that whoſoever dies with Faith in Chriſt, and Contriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for all ſins known and unknown (in which heap all his ſinful Errors muſt be comprized,) can no more be hurt by any the moſt malignant and peſtilent Error, than S. <hi>Paul</hi> by the Viper which he ſhook off into the fire. Now touching the <hi>neceſſity of Repentance from Dead works, and Faith in Chriſt Jeſus the Son of God, and Saviour of the World,</hi> they all agree; and therefore you cannot deny, but they agree about all that is ſimply neceſſary. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, though, if they ſhould go about to chooſe out of Scripture all theſe Propoſitions and Doctrines which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrate and make up the Body of Chriſtian Religion, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure there would not be ſo exact agreement amongſt them, as ſome ſay there was between the 70. Interpreters, in Tranſlating the <hi>Old Teſtament;</hi> yet thus far without Controverſie they do all agree, that in the Bible all theſe things are contained, and therefore, that whoſoever does truly and ſincerely believe the Scripture, muſt of neceſſity either in <hi>Hypotheſi,</hi> or at leaſt <hi>in theſi,</hi> either <hi>formally,</hi> or at leaſt <hi>virtually,</hi> either <hi>explicitely,</hi> or at leaſt <hi>implicitely,</hi> either in <hi>Act</hi> or at leaſt in <hi>preparation of mind,</hi> believe
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:57896:101"/>all things Fundamental: It being not Fundamental, nor required of Almighty God, to believe the true ſenſe of Scripture in all places, but only that we ſhould endeavour to do ſo, and be prepared in mind to do ſo, whenſoever it ſhall be ſufficiently propounded to us. Suppoſe a man in ſome diſeaſe were preſcribed a Medicine conſiſting of twenty ingredients, and he adviſing with Phyſitians, ſhould find them differing in Opinion about it, ſome of them telling him, that all the ingredients were abſolutely neceſſary; ſome, that only ſome of them were neceſſary, the reſt only profitable, and requiſite <hi>ad melius eſſe,</hi> laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſome, that ſome only were neceſſary, ſome profitable, and the reſt ſuperfluous, yet not hurtful; Yet all with one accord agreeing in this, That the <hi>whole receipt had in it all things neceſſary</hi> for the recovery of his health, and that if he made uſe of it, he ſhould infallibly find it ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful: what wiſe man would not think they agreed ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently for his direction to the recovery of his health? Juſt ſo, theſe <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Doctors, with whoſe diſcords you make ſuch Tragedies, agreeing in <hi>Theſi</hi> thus far, that the <hi>Scripture evidently contains all things neceſsary to Salvation,</hi> both for matter of Faith and of practice, and that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever believes it, and endeavours to find the true ſenſe of it, and to conform his Life unto it, ſhall certainly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form all things neceſſary to Salvation, and undoubtedly be ſaved; agreeing I ſay thus far, what matters it for the direction of men to Salvation, though they differ in opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, touching what points are abſolutely neceſſary, and what not? What Errors abſolutely repugnant to Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and what not? Eſpecially conſidering that although they differ about the Queſtion of the neceſſity of theſe Truths, yet for the moſt part they agree in this that Truths they are, and profitable at leaſt, though not ſimply ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary. And though they differ in the Queſtion, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the contrary Errors be deſtructive of Salvation, or no, yet in this they conſent, that Errors they are, and hurtful to Religion, though not deſtructive of Salvation. Now that which God requires of us is this; That we ſhould believe the Doctrines of the Goſpel to be Truths,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:57896:102"/>not all, neceſſary Truths, for all are not ſo, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, the repugnant Errors to be falſhoods; yet not all ſuch falſhoods, as unavoidably draw with them dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation upon all that hold them, for all do not ſo.</p>
                     <p n="53">53. Yea but <hi>you ſay, it is very requiſite we ſhould agree upon a particular Catalogue of Fundamental points, for without ſuch a Catalogue, no man can be aſſured whether or no, he hath Faith ſufficient to Salvation.</hi> This I utterly deny as a thing evidently falſe, and I wonder you ſhould content your ſelf magiſterially to ſay ſo, without offering any proof of it. I might much more juſtly, think it enough barely to deny it, without refutation, but I will not. Thus therefore I argue againſt it. Without being able to make a Catalogue of Fundamentals, I may be aſſured of the Truth of this Aſſertion, if it be true, That <hi>the Scripture contains all neceſsary points of Faith,</hi> and know that I believe explicitely all that is expreſt in Scripture, and implicitely all that is contained in them: Now he that believes all this, muſt of neceſſity believe all things neceſſary; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore without being able to make a Catalogue of Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals, I may be aſſured that I believe all things neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, and conſequently that my Faith is ſufficient. I ſaid, of the truth of this Aſſertion, <hi>if it be true:</hi> Becauſe I will not here enter into the Queſtion of the truth of it, it being ſufficient for my preſent purpoſe, that it may be true, and may be believed without any dependence upon a Catalogue of Fundamentals. And therefore if this be all your reaſon, to demand a particular Catalogue of Fundamentals, we cannot but think your demand unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable. Eſpecially having your ſelf expreſſed the cauſe of the difficulty of it, and that is, <hi>Becauſe Scripture doth deliver Divine Truths, but ſeldom qualifies them, or declares whether they be or be not abſolutely neceſſary to Salvation.</hi> Yet not ſo ſeldom, but that out of it I could give you an abſtract of the Eſſential parts of Chriſtianity, if it were neceſſary, but I have ſhewed it not ſo, by confuting your reaſon, pretended for the neceſſity of it, and at this time I have no leiſure to do you courteſies that are ſo trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſom to my ſelf. Yet thus much I will promiſe, that
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:57896:102"/>when you deliver <hi>a particular Catalogue of your Church Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals</hi> with one hand, you ſhall receive a particular Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue of what I conceive Fundamental, with the other. For as yet, I ſee no ſuch fair proceeding as you talk of, nor any performance on your own part of that which ſo clamorouſly you require on ours. For as for the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue which here you have given us, in ſaying. <hi>You are obliged under pain of damnation to believe whatſoever the Catholick viſible Church of Chriſt propoſeth as revealed by Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God,</hi> it is like a covey of one <hi>Patridg,</hi> or a flock of one ſheep, or a Fleet compoſed of one Ship, or an Army of one man. The Author of <hi>Charity Miſtaken, demands a particular Cataloge of Fundamental points;</hi> And <hi>We</hi> (ſay you) <hi>again and again demand ſuch a Catalogue.</hi> And ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if this one Propoſition, which here you think to ſtop our mouths with, be a Catalogue, yet at leaſt ſuch a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue it is not, and therefore as yet you have not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed what you require. For if to ſet down ſuch a Propoſition, wherein are comprized all points taught by us to be neceſſary to Salvation, will ſerve you inſtead of a Catalogue, you ſhall have Catalogues enough. As, we are obliged to believe all under pain of damnation which God commands us to believe. There's one Catalogue. We are obliged under pain of damnation, to believe all, whereof we may be ſufficiently aſſured, that Chriſt taught it his Apoſtles, his Apoſtles the Church. There's another. We are obliged under pain of damnation to believe Gods Word, and all contained in it to be true. There's a third. If theſe generalities will not ſatisfie you, but you will be importuning us to tell you in particular, what they are which Chriſt taught his Apoſtles, and his Apoſtles the Church, what points are contained in Gods Word; Then I beſeech you do us reaſon, and give us a particular and <hi>exact Inventory of all your Church Propoſals, without leaving out, or adding any,</hi> ſuch a one which all the Doctors of your Church will ſubſcribe to, and if you receive not then a Catalogue of Fundamentals, I for my part will give you leave to proclaim us Banckrupts.</p>

                     <p n="54">54. Beſides this deceitful generality of your Catalogue (as you call it,) another main fault we find with it, that it is extreamly ambiguous; and therefore to draw you out of the Clouds, give me leave to propoſe ſome Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to you concerning it. I would know therefore, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by believing, you mean explicitely or implicitely? If you mean implicitely, I would know whether your Churches infallibility be under pain of damnation to be believed explicitely, or no? Whether any one point or points beſides this, be under the ſame penalty, to be believed explicitely, or no? And if any, what they be? I would know what you eſteem the Propoſals of the Catholick Viſible Church? In particular, whether the Decree of a <hi>Pope ex Cathedra,</hi> that is, with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to oblige all Chriſtians by it, be a ſufficient and an obliging propoſal? Whether men without danger of damnation may examine ſuch a Decree, and if they think they have juſt cauſe, refuſe to obey it? Whether the Decree of a Council, without the <hi>Popes</hi> confirmation, be ſuch an obliging Propoſal, or no? Whether it be ſo in caſe there be no <hi>Pope,</hi> or in caſe it be doubtful who is <hi>Pope?</hi> Whether the Decree of a general Council confirmed by the <hi>Pope,</hi> be ſuch a Propoſal, and whether he be an <hi>Heretick</hi> that thinks otherwiſe? Whether the Decree of a particular Council confirmed by the <hi>Pope,</hi> be ſuch a Propoſal? Whether the General uncondemned practice of the Church for ſome Ages be ſuch a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Propoſition? Whether the conſent of the moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Fathers of any Age, agreeing in the affirmation of any Doctrine, not contradicted by any of their Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poraries, be a ſufficient Propoſition? Whether the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers teſtifying ſuch or ſuch a Doctrine or Practice to be Tradition, or to be the Doctrine or Practice of the Church, be a ſufficient aſſurance that it is ſo? Whether we be bound under pain of damnation, to believe every Text of the Vulgar Bible, now Authorized by the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> to be the true Tranſlation of the Originals of the Prophets, and Evangeliſts, and Apoſtles, without any the leaſt alteration? Whether they that lived when the

And if not of that, of what Bible they were bound to believe it? Whether the Catholick Viſible Church be alwaies that Society of Chriſtians which adheres to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome?</hi> Whether every Chriſtian, that hath ability and opportunity, be not bound to endeavour to know Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citely the Propoſals of the Church? Whether Implicite Faith in the Churches Veracity, will not ſave him that Actually and Explicitely disbelieves ſome Doctrine of the Church, not knowing it to be ſo; and Actually believes ſome damnable <hi>Hereſie,</hi> as that God has the ſhape of a man? Whether an ignorant man be bound to believe any point to be decreed by the Church, when his Prieſt or Ghoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Father aſſures him it is ſo? Whether his Ghoſtly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may not Err in telling him ſo, and whether any man can be obliged under pain of damnation, to believe an Error? Whether he be bound to believe ſuch a thing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined, when a number of Prieſts, perhaps Ten or Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty tell him it is ſo? And what aſſurance he can have, that they neither Err, nor deceive him in this matter? Why Implicite Faith in Chriſt, or the Scriptures ſhould not ſuffice for a mans Salvation, as well as implicite Faith in the Church? Whether when you ſay, <hi>Whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Church propoſeth,</hi> you mean all that ever ſhe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, or that only which ſhe now propoſeth; and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhe now propoſeth all that ever ſhe did propoſe? Whether all the Books of Canonical Scripture were ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently declared to the Church to be ſo, and propoſed as ſuch by the Apoſtles? And if not, from whom the Church had this declaration afterwards? If ſo, whether all men ever ſince the Apoſtles time, were bound un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pain of damnation to believe the Epiſtle of S. <hi>James,</hi> and the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> to be Canonical; at leaſt, not to disbelieve it, and believe the contrary? Laſtly, why it is not ſufficient for any mans Salvation to uſe the beſt means he can to inform his Conſcience, and to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the direction of it? To all theſe demands when you have given fair and ingenious anſwers, you ſhall hear further from me.</p>

                     <p n="55">55. Ad §. 20.] At the firſt entrance into this Parag. from our own Doctrine, <hi>That the Church cannot Err in Points neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, it is concluded if we are wiſe, we muſt forſake it in nothing, leaſt we ſhould forſake it in ſomething neceſſary.</hi> To which I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, Firſt, that the ſuppoſition as you underſtand it, is falſly impoſed upon us, and as we underſtand it will do you no ſervice. For when we ſay, that there ſhall be <hi>a Church alwaies,</hi> ſomewhere or other, <hi>unerring in Fundamentals,</hi> our meaning is but this, that <hi>there ſhall be alwaies a Church,</hi> to the very being whereof it is repugnant that it ſhould Err in Fundamentals; for if it ſhould do ſo, it would want the very eſſence of a Church, and therefore ceaſe to be a Church. But we never annexed this priviledg <hi>to any one Church of any one Denomination,</hi> as the <hi>Greek</hi> or the <hi>Roman</hi> Church: which if we had done, and ſet up ſome ſetled certain Society of Chriſtians, diſtinguiſhable from all others by adhering to ſuch a Biſhop for our Guide in Fundamentals, then indeed, and then only might you with ſome colour, though with no certainty, have concluded that we could not in Wiſdom, <hi>forſake this Church in any point, for fear of forſaking it in a neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry point.</hi> But now that we ſay not this of any one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate Church, which alone can perform the Office of Guide or Director, but indefinitely of the Church, meaning no more but this, <hi>That there ſhall be alwaies in ſome place or other, ſome Church that Errs not in Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals;</hi> will you conclude from hence, that we cannot in Wiſdom forſake this or that, the <hi>Roman</hi> or the <hi>Greek</hi> Church, for fear of Erring in Fundamentals?</p>
                     <p n="56">56. Yea, but you may ſay (for I will make the beſt I can of all your Arguments,) <hi>That this Church thus un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erring in Fundamentals, when</hi> Luther <hi>aroſe, was by our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion the</hi> Roman; <hi>and therefore we ought not in Wiſdom to have departed from it in any thing.</hi> I anſwer: Firſt, that we confeſs no ſuch thing, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was then this Church, but only a Part of it, and that the moſt corrupted and moſt incorrigible. Secondly, that if by adhering to the Church, we could have been thus far ſecured, this Argument had ſome ſhew of reaſon. But
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:57896:104"/>ſeeing we are not warranted thus much by any priviledg of that Church, that ſhe cannot Err Fundamentally, but only from Scripture, which aſſures us that ſhe doth Err very heinouſly, collect our hope, that the Truths ſhe retains and the practice of them, may prove an Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dote to her, againſt the Errors which ſhe maintains in ſuch Perſons, as in ſimplicity of Heart follow this <hi>Abſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lom;</hi> we ſhould then do againſt the light of our Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and ſo ſin damnably if we ſhould not abandon the profeſſion of her Errors though not Fundamental. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can we thus conclude, we may ſafely hold with the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in all her points, for ſhe cannot Err damnably; For this is falſe, ſhe may, though perhaps ſhe does not: But rather thus, Theſe points of Chriſtianity, which have in them the nature of Antidotes againſt the Poyſon of all Sins and Errors, the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> though otherwiſe much corrupted, ſtill retains; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we hope ſhe Errs not Fundamentally, but ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains a Part of the Church. But this can be no warrant to us to think with her in all things: ſeeing the very ſame Scripture, which puts us in hope ſhe Errs not Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentally, aſſures us that in many things, and thoſe of great moment ſhe Errs very greviouſly. And theſe Errors though to them that believe them, we hope they will not be pernitious, yet the profeſſing of them againſt Conſcience, could not but bring us to certain damnation. <hi>As for the fear of departing from ſome Fundamental Truths withal, while we depart from her Errors,</hi> Happily it might work upon us, if adhering to her might ſecure us from it, and if nothing elſe could: But both theſe are falſe. For firſt, adhering to her in all things cannot ſecure us from erring in Fundamentals: Becauſe though <hi>de facto</hi> we hope ſhe does not Err, yet we know no priviledges ſhe has, but ſhe may Err in them her ſelf: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we had need have better ſecurity hereof than her bare Authority. Then ſecondly, without dependence on her at all, we may be ſecured that we do not Err Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentally; I mean by believing all thoſe things plainly ſet down in Scripture, wherein all things neceſſary, and
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:57896:105"/>moſt things profitable are plainly delivered. Suppoſe I were Travelling to <hi>London,</hi> and knew two ways thither, the one very ſafe and convenient, the other very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenient, and dangerous, but yet a way to <hi>London:</hi> and that I overtook a Paſſenger on the way, who him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf believed, and would fain perſwade me, there was no other way but the worſe, and would perſwade me to accompany him in it, becauſe I confeſſed his way, though very inconvenient, yet a way; ſo that going that way we could not fail of our Journies end, by the conſent of both Parties: but he believed, my way to be none at all; and therefore I might juſtly fear, leſt out of a deſire of leaving the worſt way, I left the true, and the only way: If now I ſhould not be more ſecure upon my own know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, than frighted by this fallacity, would you not beg me for a Fool? Juſt ſo might you think of us, if we would be frighted out of our own knowledge by this bugbear. For the only and the main reaſon why we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve you not to Err in Fundamentals, is your holding the <hi>Doctrines of Faith in Chriſt and Repentance:</hi> which know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we hold as well as you, notwithſtanding our depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from you, we muſt needs know that we not Err in Fundamentals, as well as we know that you do not Err in ſome Fundamentals, and therefore cannot poſſibly fear the contrary. Yet let us be more liberal to you, and grant that which can never be proved, that God had ſaid in plain terms, <hi>The Church of</hi> Rome <hi>ſhall never deſtroy the Foundation,</hi> but withal had ſaid, <hi>that it might and would lay much Hay and Stubble upon it;</hi> That you ſhould never hold any Error deſtructive of Salvation, but yet many that were prejudicial to Edification: I demand, might we have diſpenſed with our ſelves in the believing and profeſſing theſe Errors in regard of the ſmalneſs of them? Or had it not been a damnable ſin to do ſo, though the Errors in themſelves were not damnable? Had we not had as plain Direction to depart from you in ſome things profitable, as to adhere to you in things neceſſary? In the beginning of your Book, when it was for your purpoſe to have it ſo, the greatneſs or ſmalneſs of
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:57896:105"/>the matter was not conſiderable, the Evidence of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation was all in all. But here we muſt err with you in ſmall things, for fear of looſing your direction in greater: and for fear of departing too far from you, not go from you at all, even where we ſee plainly that you have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from the Truth.</p>
                     <p n="57">57. Beyond all this, I ſay, that this which you ſay <hi>in wiſdom we are to do,</hi> is not only unlawful, but, if we will proceed according to reaſon, impoſſible. I mean to adhere to you in all things, having no other ground for it, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you are (as we will now ſuppoſe) Infallible in ſome things, that is, in Fundamentals. For, whether by skill in Architecture a large ſtructure may be ſupported by a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row foundation, I know not; but ſure I am, in reaſon, no concluſion can be larger than the Principles on which it is founded. And therefore if I conſider what I do, and be perſwaded, that your infallibility, is but limited, and particular, and partial, my adherence upon this ground, cannot poſſibly be Abſolute and Univerſal and Total. I am confident, that ſhould I meet with ſuch a man amongſt you (as I am well aſſur'd there be many) that would grant your Church Infallible only in Fundamentals, which what they are he knows not, and therefore upon this only reaſon adheres to you in all things: I ſay that I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that it may be demonſtrated, that ſuch a man ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heres to you, with a fiducial and certain aſſent in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. To make this clear (becauſe at the firſt hearing it may ſeem ſtrange) give me leave, good Sir, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe you the man, and to propoſe to you a few queſtions, and to give for you ſuch anſwers to them, as upon this ground you muſt of neceſſity give, were you preſent with me. Firſt, ſuppoſing you hold your Church Infallible in Fundamentals, obnoxious to Error in other things, and that you know not what points are Fundamental, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, <hi>C.</hi> Why do you believe the Doctrin of Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation? <hi>K.</hi> becauſe the Church hath taught it, which is Infallible. <hi>C.</hi> What? Infallible in all things, or only in Fundamentals? <hi>K.</hi> in Fundamentals only. <hi>C.</hi> Then in other points ſhe may err? <hi>K.</hi> ſhe may. <hi>C.</hi> and do you know
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:57896:106"/>what Points are Fundamental, what not? <hi>K.</hi> No, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I believe her in all things, leaſt I ſhould disbelieve her in fundamentals. <hi>C.</hi> How know you then, whether this be a fundamental point or no? <hi>K.</hi> I know not. <hi>C.</hi> It may be then (for ought you know) an unfundamental point? <hi>K.</hi> yes, it may be ſo. <hi>C.</hi> And in theſe you ſaid the Church may err? <hi>K.</hi> yes I did ſo. <hi>C.</hi> Then poſſibly it may err in this? <hi>K.</hi> It may do ſo. <hi>C.</hi> Then what certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty have you, that it does not err in it? <hi>K.</hi> None at all, but upon this ſuppoſition, that this is a Fundamental. <hi>C.</hi> And this ſuppoſition you are uncertain of? <hi>K.</hi> Yes, I told you ſo before. <hi>C.</hi> And therefore, you can have no certainty of that, which depends upon this uncertainty, ſaving only a ſuppoſitive certainty, if it be a Fundamental truth, which is in plain Engliſh to ſay, you are certain it is true, if it be both true and neceſſary. Verily Sir, if you have no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Faith than this, you are no Catholick. <hi>K.</hi> good words I pray! I am ſo, and God willing will be ſo. <hi>C.</hi> You mean, in outward profeſſion and practice, but in belief you are not, no more than a <hi>Proteſtant</hi> is a <hi>Catholick.</hi> For every <hi>Proteſtant</hi> yields ſuch a kind of aſſent to all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals of the Church, for ſurely they believe them true, if they be Fundamental Truths. And therefore you muſt either believe the Church Infallible in all her propoſals, be they foundations, or be they ſuperſtructions, or elſe you muſt believe all Fundamental which ſhe propoſes, or elſe you are no <hi>Catholick. K.</hi> But I have been taught, that <hi>ſeeing I believed the Church Infallible in points neceſſary, in wiſdom I was to believe her in every thing. C.</hi> That was a pretty plauſible inducement, to bring you hither, but now you are here, you muſt go farther, and believe her Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible in all things, or elſe you were as good go back again, which will be a great diſparagement to you, and draw upon you both the bitter and implacable hatred of our part, and even with your own, the imputation of raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and levity. You ſee, I hope, by this time, that though a man did believe your Church Infallible in Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals, yet he has no reaſon to do you the courteſie, of believing all her propoſals; nay if he be ignorant what
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:57896:106"/>theſe Fundamentals are, he has no certain ground to believe her, upon her Authority in any thing. And whereas you ſay, it can be no imprudence to err with the Church; I ſay, it may be very great imprudence, if the queſtion be, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we ſhould err with the preſent Church, or hold true with God Almighty.</p>
                     <p n="60">60. Whereas you add, That <hi>that viſible Church which cannot err in Fundamental, propounds all her definitions without diſtinction to be believed under</hi> Anathema's: <hi>Anſ.</hi> Again you beg the queſtion, ſuppoſing untruly, that there is, any <hi>that Viſible Church,</hi> I mean any Viſible Church of one De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination, which cannot err in points Fundamental. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, propoſing definitions to be believed under Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thema's, is no good argument, that the Propounders con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive themſelves infallible; but only, that they conceive the Doctrine they condemn is evidently damnable. A plain proof hereof is this, that particular Councils, nay particular men, have been very liberal of their Anathema's, which yet were never conceived infallible, either by others or themſelves. If any man ſhould now deny Chriſt to be the Saviour of the world, or deny the Reſurrection, I ſhould make no great ſcruple of Anathematizing his Doctrine, and yet am very far from dreaming of Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility.</p>
                     <p n="62">62. The effect of the next Argument is this, <hi>I cannot without grievous ſin diſobey the Church, unleſs I know ſhe commands thoſe things which are not in her power to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand: and how far this power extends, none can better inform me than the Church. Therefore I am to obey, ſo far as the Church requires my obedience.</hi> I Anſwer, Firſt, That neither hath the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> but only a corrupt part of it decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red her ſelf, nor required our obedience, in the points conteſted among us. This therefore is falſely, and vainly ſuppoſed here by you, being one of the greateſt queſtions amongſt us. Then Secondly, That God can better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form us, what are the limits of the Churches power, than the Church her ſelf, that is, than the <hi>Roman</hi> Clergy, who being men ſubject to the ſame paſſions with other men, why they ſhould be thought the beſt Judges in their own
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:57896:107"/>cauſe, I do not well underſtand! But yet we oppoſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, no human deciſive Judges, not any Sect or Perſon, but only God and his Word. And therefore it is in vain to ſay, That <hi>in following her, you ſhall be ſooner excuſed, than in following any Sect or Man applying Scriptures againſt her Doctrine:</hi> In as much as we never went about to arrogate to our ſelves that Infallibility or abſolute Authority, which we take away from you. But if you would have ſpoken to the purpoſe, you ſhould have ſaid, that in following her you ſhould ſooner have been excuſed, than in cleaving to the Scripture, and to God himſelf.</p>
                     <p n="63">63. Whereas you ſay, <hi>The fearful examples of innumerable perſons, who forſaking the Church, upon pretence of her errors, have failed even in fundamental points, ought to deter all Chriſtians from oppoſing her in any one doctrine or practice;</hi> This is, juſt as if you ſhould ſay, divers men have fallen into <hi>Scylla,</hi> with going too far from <hi>Charybdis,</hi> be ſure therefore ye keep cloſe to <hi>Charybdis:</hi> divers leaving pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digality, have fallen into covetouſneſs, therefore be you conſtant to prodigality; many have fallen from worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping God perverſely and fooliſhly, not to worſhip him at all, from worſhipping many Gods, to worſhip none; this therefore ought to deter men, from leaving Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Idolatry, for fear of falling into Atheiſm and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety. This is your counſel and Sophiſtry: but God ſays clean contrary; <hi>Take heed you ſwerve not, either to the right hand or to the left: you muſt not do evil that good may come thereon;</hi> therefore neither that you may avoid a greater evil, you muſt not be obſtinate in a certain error, for fear of an uncertain. What if ſome, forſaking the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> have forſaken Fundamental Truths? Was this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they forſook the Church of <hi>Rome?</hi> No ſure, this is <hi>non cauſa pro cauſa:</hi> for elſe all that have forſaken that Church ſhould have done ſo, which we ſay they have not. But becauſe they went too far from her, the golden mean, the narrow way is hard to be found, and hard to be kept; hard, but not impoſſible: hard, but yet you muſt not pleaſe your ſelf out of it, though you err on the right hand, though you offend on the milder part, for this is
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:57896:107"/>the only way that leads to life, and few there be that find it. It is true, if we ſaid, there were no danger in being of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and there were danger in leaving it, it were madneſs to perſwade any man to leave it. But we proteſt and proclaim the contrary, and that we have very little hope of their Salvation, who either out of negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in ſeeking the truth, or unwillingneſs to find it, live and die in the errors and impieties of that Church: and therefore cannot but conceive thoſe fears to be moſt fooliſh and ridiculous, which perſwade men to be conſtant in one way to hell, leſt happily if they leave it, they ſhould fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to another.</p>
                     <p n="64">64. Obj. <hi>Some Proteſtants, pretending to reform the Church, are come to affirm that ſhe periſhed for many Ages, which others cannot deny to be a Fundamental Error againſt the Article of the Creed, I believe the Catholick Church, and affirm the</hi> Donatiſts <hi>erred Fundamentally in confining it to</hi> Africa.</p>
                     <p>To this I Anſwer, Firſt, that the error of the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> was not, that they held it poſſible that ſome, or many, or moſt parts of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> might fall away from Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and that the Church may looſe much of her ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and be contracted to a narrow compaſs in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of her former extent; which is proved not only poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible but certain, by irrefragable experience. For who knows not, that <hi>Gentiliſm,</hi> and <hi>Mahumetiſm,</hi> mans wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs deſerving it, and Gods providence permitting it, have prevailed to the utter extirpation of Chriſtianity, upon far the greater part of the world? And S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> when he was out of the heat of Diſputation, confeſſes the Militant Church to be <hi>like the Moon,</hi> ſometimes increaſing, and ſometimes decreaſing. This therefore was no error in the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> that they held it poſſible, that the Church, from a larger extent, might be contradicted to a leſſer: or that they held it poſſible to be reduced to <hi>Africa;</hi> (For why not to <hi>Africk</hi> then, as well as within theſe few ages, you pretend it was to <hi>Europe?</hi>) But their error was, that they held <hi>de facto,</hi> this was done when they had no juſt ground or reaſon to do ſo; and ſo upon a vain pretence which they could not juſtify, ſeparated themſelves from the communion of
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:57896:108"/>all other parts of the Church: and that they required it as a neceſſary condition to make a man a member of the Church, that he ſhould be of their Communion, and divide himſelf from all other Communions from which they were divided: which was a condition both unneceſſary and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful to be required, and therefore the exacting of it was directly oppoſite to the Churches Catholiciſm; in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſame nature with their Errors who required Circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the keeping of the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> as neceſſary to ſalvation. For whoſoever requires harder or heavier condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of men, than God requires of them, he it is that is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly an Enemy of the Churches Univerſality, by hindring either Men or Countries from adjoyning themſelves to it; which, were it not for theſe unneceſſary and therefore un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful conditions, in probability would have made them members of it. And ſeeing the preſent Church of <hi>Rome</hi> perſwades men they were as good (for any hope of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they have) not to be Chriſtians as not to be <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks, believe nothing at all, as not to believe all which they impoſe upon them: Be abſolutely out of the Churches Communion, as be out of their Communion, or be in any other, whether they be not guilty of the ſame crime, with the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> and thoſe Zelots of the Moſaical Law, I leave it to the judgment of thoſe that underſtand reaſon! This is ſufficient to ſhew the vanity of this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But I add moreover, that you neither have named thoſe <hi>Proteſtants</hi> who held the Church to have periſhed for many ages; who perhaps held not the deſtruction but the corruption of the Church; not that the true Church, but that the pure Church periſhed: or rather that the Church periſhed not from its life and exiſtence, but from its puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and integrity, or perhaps from its ſplendor and viſibility. Neither have you proved by any one reaſon, but only af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed it, to be a fundamental Error, to hold that the Church Militant may poſſibly be driven out of the world, and aboliſhed for a time from the face of the earth.</p>
                     <p n="69">69. Ad §. 23. In all theſe Texts of Scripture, which are here alledged in this laſt Section of this Chapter, or in any one of them, or in any other, doth God ſay clearly and
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:57896:108"/>plainly, <hi>The Biſhop of</hi> Rome <hi>and that Society of Chriſtians which adheres to him ſhall be ever the infallible guide of Faith?</hi> You will confeſs, I preſume, he doth not, and will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, it was not neceſſary. Yet if the King ſhould tell us the Lord-Keeper ſhould judge ſuch and ſuch cauſes, but ſhould either not tell us at all, or tell us but doubtfully who ſhould be Lord-Keeper, ſhould we be any thing the nearer for him to an end of contentions? Nay rather would not the diſſentions about the Perſon who it is, increaſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, rather than end them? Juſt ſo it would have been, if God had appointed a Church to be Judge of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies, and had not told us which was that Church. Seeing therefore God does nothing in vain, and ſeeing it had been in vain, to appoint a Judge of Controverſies, and not to tell us plainly who it is, and ſeeing laſtly, he hath not told us plainly, no not at all who it is, is it not evident he hath appointed none? <hi>Obj.</hi> But (you will ſay perhaps) <hi>if it be granted once, that ſome Church of one denomination, is the Infallible guide of Faith, it will be no difficult thing to prove, that yours is the Church, ſeeing no other Church pretends to be ſo.</hi> Anſ. Yes, the Primitive and the Apoſtolick Church pretends to be ſo. That aſſures us, that the <hi>ſpirit was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, and given to them, to lead them into all ſaving truth,</hi> that they might lead others. Obj. <hi>But that Church is not now in the world, and how then can it pretend to be the guide of Faith? Anſ.</hi> It is now in the world ſufficiently, to be our guide: not by the perſons of thoſe men that were mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of it, but by their Writings which do plainly teach us, what truth they were led into, and ſo lead us into the ſame truth. Obj. <hi>But theſe Writings, were the Writings of ſome particular men, and not of the Church of thoſe times: how then doth that Church guide us by theſe Writings? Now theſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſhew that a Church is to be our guide, therefore they cannot be ſo avoided. Anſ.</hi> If you regard the conception and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of theſe Writings, they were the Writings of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular men: But if you regard the reception, and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of them, they may be well called the Writings of the Church, as having the atteſtation of the Church, to have been written by thoſe that were inſpired, and
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:57896:109"/>directed by God. As a Statute, though penned by ſome one man, yet being ratified by the Parliament, is called the Act, not of that man, but of the Parliament. Obj. But the <hi>words ſeem clearly enough to prove, that the Church, the preſent Church of every Age, is Univerſally infallible.

                     <p>Secondly, he may fall into ſome Error, even contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the truth which is taught him, if it be taught him <hi>only ſufficiently, and not irreſiſtibly,</hi> ſo that he may learn it if he will, not ſo that he muſt and ſhall, whether he will or no. Now who can aſſertain me, that the Spirits teaching is not of this nature? Or how can you poſſibly reconcile it, with your Doctrine of free-will in believing, if it be not of this nature? Beſides, the word in the Original is <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, which ſignifies, to be a guide and director only, not to compel or neceſſitate. Who knows not, that a guide may ſet you in the right way, and you may either negligently miſtake, or willingly leave it? And to what purpoſe doth God conplain ſo often, and ſo earneſtly of ſome, that <hi>had eyes to ſee and would not ſee, that ſtopped their Ears, and cloſed their Eyes, leſt they ſhould hear and ſee?</hi> Of others <hi>that would not underſtand, leſt they ſhould do good: that the Light ſhined, and the Darkneſs comprehended it not:</hi> That <hi>he came unto his own, and his own received him not: That light came into the World, and Men loved Darkneſs more than Light: To what purpoſe ſhould he wonder, ſo few believed his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, and that to ſo few his Arm was revealed: And that when he comes, he ſhould find no Faith upon Earth; If his outward teaching were not of this nature,</hi> that it might be followed, and might be reſiſted? And if it be, then God may teach, and the Church not learn: God may lead, and the Church be refractory and not follow. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, who can doubt, that hath not his Eyes vailed with prejudice, that God hath taught the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> plain enough in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> that <hi>all things in the Church are to be done for edification,</hi> and that, in any publick Prayers, or Thanks-givings, or Hymns, or Leſſons of inſtruction, to <hi>uſe a Language,</hi> which the aſſiſtants <hi>generally underſtand not,</hi> is not for edification? Though the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> will not learn this, for fear of confeſſing an Error, and ſo overthrowing her Authority, yet the time will come, when it ſhall appear, that not only by ſcripture, they were taught this ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently, and commanded to believe, but by reaſon and
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:57896:110"/>common ſenſe. And ſo for the Communion, in both kinds, who can deny but they are taught it by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour <hi>John</hi> 6. in theſe Words, according to moſt of your own expoſitions, <hi>Unleſs you Eat the Fleſh of the Son of Man, and Drink his Blood, you have no Life in you.</hi> (If our Saviour ſpeak there of the Sacrament, as to them he does, becauſe they conceive he does ſo) Though they may pretend, that receiving in one kind, they receive the Blood together with the Body, yet they can with no Face pretend that they drink it: And ſo obey not our Saviours injunction according to the letter, which yet they <hi>profeſs it literally, always to be obeyed, unleſs ſome impiety, or ſome abſurdity force us to the contrary:</hi> and they are not yet arrived to that impudence to pretend, that either there is impiety or abſurdity in receiving the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion in both kinds. This therefore they if not others, are plainly taught by our Saviour in this place. But by S. <hi>Paul</hi> all without exception, when he ſays, <hi>Let a man examine himſelf, and ſo let him Eat of this Bread and Drink of this Chalice.</hi> This <hi>(a Man)</hi> that is to examine him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, is <hi>every man,</hi> that can do it: as is confeſſed on all hands.

Yet we ſee they neither do, nor will learn them. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude therefore, that the Spirit may very well teach the Church, and yet the Church fall into and continue in Error, by not regarding what ſhe is taught by the Spirit.</p>

But all this I have ſpoken upon a ſuppoſition only, and ſhewed unto you, that though theſe promiſes, had been made unto the preſent Church of every Age (I might have ſaid though they had been to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> by name,) yet no certainty of her Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Infallibility could be built upon them. But the plain truth is, that theſe Promiſes are vainly arrogated by you, and were never made to you, but to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:57896:110"/>only. I pray deal ingenuouſly and tell me, who were they of whom our Saviour ſays, <hi>Theſe things have I ſpoken unto you, being preſent with you.</hi> c. 14.25. <hi>But the comforter, ſhall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatſoever I have told you</hi> v. 26? Who are they to whom he ſays, <hi>I go away and come again unto you; and I have told you before it come to paſs:</hi> v. 28.29. <hi>You have been with me from the beginning:</hi> c. 15. v. 27? And again, <hi>theſe things I have told you, that when the time ſhall come, you may remember that I told you of them: and theſe things I ſaid not to you at the beginning, becauſe I was with you,</hi> c. 16.4. <hi>And becauſe I ſaid theſe things unto you, ſorrow hath filled your Hearts,</hi> v. 6? Laſtly, who are they of whom he ſaith, v. 12. <hi>I have yet many things to ſay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, but ye cannot bear them now?</hi> Do not all theſe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances appropriate this whole diſcourſe of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour to his Diſciples, that were then with him, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, reſtrain the Promiſes of the Spirit of truth, which was <hi>to lead them into all truth,</hi> to their Perſons on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly? And ſeeing it is ſo, is it not an impertinent arrogance and preſumption, for you to lay claim unto them, in the behalf of your Church? Had Chriſt been preſent with your Church? Did the Comforter bring theſe things to the Remembrance of your Church, which Chriſt had before taught and ſhe had forgotten? Was Chriſt then departing from your Church? And did he tell of his departure before it came to paſs? Was your Church with him from the beginning? Was your Church filled with ſorrow, upon the mentioning of Chriſts departure? Or laſtly, did he, or could he have ſaid to your Church, which then was not extant, <hi>I have yet many things to ſay unto you, but ye cannot bear them now?</hi> as he ſpeaks in the 13. <hi>verſ.</hi> immediately before the words by you quoted. And then goes on, <hi>Howbeit when the Spirit of truth is come, he will guide you into all Truth.</hi> Is it not the ſame <hi>You</hi> he ſpeaks to, in the 13. <hi>verſ.</hi> and that he ſpeaks to in the 14? And is it not apparent to any one that has but half an Eye, that in the 13. he ſpeaks only to them that then were with him? Beſides in the very Text by you
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:57896:111"/>alledged, there are things promiſed, which your Church cannot with any modeſty pretend to. For there it is ſaid, <hi>the Spirit of Truth,</hi> not only <hi>will guide you into all Truth,</hi> but alſo <hi>will ſhew you things to come.</hi> Now your Church (for ought I could ever underſtand) does not ſo much as pretend to the Spirit of Propheſie, and knowledge of future events: And therefore hath as little cauſe to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to the former promiſe, of being <hi>led by the Spirit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all truth.</hi> And this is the Reaſon, why both You in this place, and generally, your writers of Controverſies, when they entreat of this Argument, cite this Text per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually by halfs, there being in the latter part of it, a clear, and convincing Demonſtration, that you have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do with the former. Unleſs you will ſay, which which is moſt ridiculous, that when our Saviour ſaid, <hi>He will teach you,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>he will ſhew you,</hi> &amp;c. He meant one <hi>You</hi> in the former clauſe, and another <hi>You</hi> in the latter.</p>
                     <p n="73">73. <hi>Obj.</hi> But this <hi>is to confine Gods Spirit to the Apoſtles only, or to the Diſciples, that then were preſent with him: which is directly contrary to many places of Scripture.</hi> Anſ. I confeſs, that to confine the Spirit of God to thoſe that were then preſent with Chriſt is againſt Scripture. But I hope it is eaſie to conceive a difference, between con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> to them: and confining <hi>the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes made in this place</hi> to them. God may do many things which he does not Promiſe at all: much more, which he does not promiſe in ſuch or ſuch a place.</p>
                     <p n="74">74. <hi>Obj.</hi> But <hi>it is promiſed in the</hi> 14. <hi>Chap. that this Spirit ſhall abide with them for ever: Now they in their perſons were not to abide for ever; and therefore the Spirit could not abide with them, in their Perſons for ever, ſeeing the coexiſtence of two things, ſuppoſes of neceſſity, the exiſtence of either. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the promiſe was not made to them only in their Perſons, but by them to the Church, which was to abide for ever.</hi> Anſ. Your Concluſion is, <hi>not to them only,</hi> but your Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon concludes, either nothing at all, or that this Promiſe of abiding with them for ever, was not made to their Perſons at all; or if it were, that it was not performed. Or if you will not ſay (as I hope you will not) that it was
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:57896:111"/>not performed, nor that it was not made to their Perſons at all; then muſt you grant, that the Word <hi>for ever,</hi> is here uſed in a ſenſe reſtrained, and accommodated to the ſubject here entreated of; and that it ſignifies, <hi>not Eternal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> without end of time, <hi>but perpetually</hi> without interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for the time of their lives. So that the force, and ſenſe of the Words is, that they ſhould never want the Spirits aſſiſtance, in the performance of their function: And that the Spirit would not (as Chirſt was to do,) ſtay with them for a time, and afterwards leave them, but would abide with them, if they kept their ſtation, unto the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry end of their lives, which is mans <hi>for ever.</hi> Neither is this uſe of the word, <hi>for ever,</hi> any thing ſtrange, either in our ordinary ſpeech, wherein we uſe to ſay, this is mine for ever, this ſhall be yours for ever, without ever dreaming of the Eternity, either of the thing or Perſons. And then in Scripture, it not only will bear, but requires this ſenſe very frequently, as <hi>Exod.</hi> 21.6. <hi>Deut.</hi> 15.17. <hi>his Maſter ſhall bore his Ear through with an Awl, and he ſhall ſerve him for ever.</hi> Pſal. 52.9. <hi>I will praiſe thee for ever.</hi> Pſal. 61.4. <hi>I will abide in thy Tahernacle for ever.</hi> Pſal. 119.111. <hi>Thy Teſtimonies have I taken as mine Heritage for ever:</hi> and laſtly in the Epiſtle to <hi>Philemon, He therefore departed from thee for a time, that thou ſhouldeſt receive him for ever.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="75">75. And thus, I preſume, I have ſhewed ſufficiently, that this <hi>for ever,</hi> hinders not, but that the promiſe may be appropriated to the Apoſtles, as by many other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances I have evinced it muſt be. But what now, if the place produced by you, as a main pillar of your Churches Infallibility, prove upon Tryal, an Engine to batter and overthrow it, at leaſt, (which is all one to my purpoſe) to take away all poſſibility of our aſſurance of it? This will ſeem ſtrange news to you at firſt hearing, and not far from a prodigy. And I confeſs, as you here in this place, and generally all your Writers of Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie, by whom this Text is urged, order the matter, it is very much diſabled, to do any ſervice againſt you in this queſtion. For with a bold ſacriledg, and horrible im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:57896:112"/>ſomewhat like <hi>Procruſtes</hi> his cruelty, you perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally cut off the Head and Foot, the beginning and end of it; and preſenting to your confidents, who uſually read no more of the Bible, than is alledged by you, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly theſe words, <hi>I will ask my Father, and he ſhall give you another Paraclete, that he may abide with you for ever, even the Spirit of Truth,</hi> conceal in the mean time, the words before, and the words after; that ſo, the promiſe of Gods Spirit, may ſeem to be abſolute, whereas it is indeed moſt clearly and expreſly conditional: being both in the words before, reſtrained to thoſe only, that <hi>love God and keep his commandments:</hi> and in the words after, flatly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied to all, whom the Scriptures ſtile by the name of <hi>the World,</hi> that is, as the very <hi>Antitheſis</hi> give us plainly to underſtand, <hi>to all wicked and worldly men.</hi> Behold the place entire, as it is ſet down in your own Bible. <hi>If ye love me keep my Commandments, and I will ask my Father, and he ſhall give you another Paraclete, that he may abide with you for ever, even the ſpirit of the Truth, whom the. World cannot receive.</hi> Now from the place there reſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and vindicated from your mutilation, thus I argue againſt your pretence. We can have no certainty of the Infallibility of your Church, but upon this ſupoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that your <hi>Popes</hi> are infallible in confirming the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of General Councils: we can have no certainty hereof, but upon this ſuppoſition, that the Spirit of truth is promiſed to him, for his direction in this work. And of this again we can have no certainty, but upon ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal, that he performs the condition, whereunto the promiſe of the Spirit of truth is expreſly limited, <hi>viz. That he love God and keep his Commandments;</hi> and of this finally, not knowing the <hi>Popes</hi> Heart, we can have no certainty at all; therefore from the firſt to the laſt, we can have no certainty at all of your Churches Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility. This is my firſt Argument: From this place ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther follows, which will charge you as home as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. If many of the <hi>Roman</hi> See, were ſuch men as could not receive the Spirit of Truth, even men of the World, that is Worldly, Wicked, Carnal, Diabolical men, then
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:57896:112"/>the Spirit of Truth, is not here promiſed, but flatly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied them: and conſequently we can have no certainty, neither of the Decrees of Councils, which theſe <hi>Popes</hi> confirm, nor of the Churches Infallibility, which is guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by theſe Decrees: But many of the <hi>Roman</hi> See, even by the confeſſion of the moſt zealous Defenders of it, were ſuch men: therefore the Spirit of truth is not here promiſed but denyed them, and conſequently we can have no certainty, neither of the Decrees which they confirm, nor of the Churches Infallibility, which guides her ſelf by theſe Decrees.</p>
                     <p n="76">76. You may take as much time as you think fit, to anſwer theſe Arguments. In the mean while I proceed to the conſideration of the next Text alledged for this purpoſe by you: out of S. <hi>Paul</hi> 1. Epiſtle to <hi>Timothy:</hi> cap. 3.15. where he ſaith, as you ſay <hi>the Church is the Pillar and ground of truth,</hi> But the truth is you are ſomewhat to bold with S. <hi>Paul.</hi> For he ſays not in formal terms, what you make him ſay, <hi>the Church is the Pillar and Ground of Truth,</hi> neither is it certain that he means ſo: for it is neither impeſſible nor improbable, that the words <hi>the Pillar and Gonnd of truth,</hi> may have reference not to the Church, but to <hi>Timothy,</hi> the ſenſe of the place <hi>that thou maieſt know how to behave thy ſelf, as a Pillar and ground of truth, in the Church of God, which is the houſe of the living God,</hi> which expoſition offers no violence at all to the words, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuppoſes an Ellipſis of the Particle <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, in the Greek very ordinary. Neither wants it ſome likelihood, that S. <hi>Paul</hi> comparing the Church to a Houſe, ſhould here exhort <hi>Timothy,</hi> to carry himſelf, as a Pillar in that Houſe ſhould do, according as he had given other Principal men in the Church, the name of Pillars; rather than, having called the Church a <hi>Houſe,</hi> to call it preſently a <hi>Pillar;</hi> which may ſeem ſomewhat heterogeneous. Yet if you will needs have S. <hi>Paul</hi> refer this not to <hi>Timothy</hi> but the Church, I will not contend about it any farther, than to ſay, poſſibly it may be otherwiſe. But then ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, I am to put you in mind, that the Church which S. <hi>Paul</hi> here ſpeaks of, was that in which <hi>Timothy</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed,
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:57896:113"/>and that was a Particular Church, and not the <hi>Roman;</hi> and ſuch you will not have to be Univerſally Infallible.</p>
                     <p n="77">77. Thirdly, if we grant you out of Courteſie (for nothing can enforce us to it) that he both ſpeaks of the Univerſal Church, and ſays this of it, then I am to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member you, that many Attributes in Scripture are not Notes of Performance but of Duty, and teach us not what the thing or Perſon is of neceſſity, but what it ſhould be. <hi>Ye are the Salt of the Earth,</hi> ſaid our Saviour to his Diſciples: not that this quality was inſeparable from their Perſons, but becauſe it was their Office to be ſo. For if they muſt have been ſo of neceſſity, and could not have been otherwiſe, in vain had he put them in fear of that which follows, <hi>If the Salt hath loſt his ſavour, wherewith ſhall it be Salted? it is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be caſt forth, and to be trodden under Foot.</hi> So the Church may be by Duty, the Pillar and Ground, that is, the Teacher of Truth, of all truth, not only neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry but profitable to Salvation; and yet ſhe may neglect and violate this Duty, and be in fact, the teacher of ſome Error.</p>
                     <p n="78">78. Fourthly and laſtly, if we deal moſt liberally with you, and grant that the Apoſtle here ſpeaks of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church, calls it the <hi>Pillar and ground of Truth,</hi> and that not only becauſe it ſhould, but becauſe it always ſhall and will be ſo, yet after all this, you have done nothing; your Bridge is too ſhort, to bring you to the Bank where you would be, unleſs you can ſhew that by truth here, is certainly meant, not only <hi>all neceſſary</hi> to Salvation, but all that is profitable, abſolutely and <hi>ſimply All.</hi> For that the true Church alwaies ſhall be the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainer and teacher of all neceſſary truth, you know we grant and muſt grant, for it is of the eſſence of the Church to be ſo, and any company of Men were no more a Church without it, than any thing can be a Man, and not be reaſonable. But as a Man may be ſtill a Man, though he want a Hand or an Eye, which yet are profitable parts, ſo the Church may be ſtill a
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:57896:113"/>Church, though it be defective in ſome profitable truth. And as a Man may be a Man, that has ſome Boyls and Botches on his Body, ſo the Church may be the Church, though it have many corruptions both in Doctrine and practice.</p>
                     <p n="79">79. And thus you ſee we are at liberty from the former places; having ſhewed that the ſenſe of them, either muſt or may be ſuch as will do your Cauſe no ſervice. But the laſt you ſuppoſe, will be a <hi>Gordian</hi> knot, and ties us faſt enough: The words are, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.11, 12, 13. <hi>He gave ſome Apoſtles, and ſome Prophets,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>to the conſummation of Saints, to the work of the Miniſtry,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Until we all meet into the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Faith,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>That we be not hereafter Children, waver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and carried up and down with every wind of Doctrine.</hi> Out of which words, this is the only argument which you collect, or I can collect for you. There is no means to conſerve unity of Faith, againſt every wind of Doctrine, unleſs it be a Church univerſally Infallible. But it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious to ſay there is no means to conſerve unity of Faith againſt every wind of Doctrine: Therefore there muſt be a Church univerſally Infallible. Whereunto I anſwer, that your major is ſo far from being confirmed, that it is plainly confuted, by the place alledged. For that tells us of another means for this purpoſe, to wit, the <hi>Apoſtles, and Prophets, and Evangeliſts, and Paſtors, and Doctors,</hi> which Chriſt gave upon his Aſcenſion, and that their <hi>conſumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Saints, doing the work of the Miniſtry,</hi> and <hi>Edifying the body of Chriſt,</hi> was the means to bring thoſe (which are there ſpoken of, be they who they will,) to <hi>the unity of Faith, and to perfection in Chriſt,</hi> that they might not be <hi>wavering, and carried about, with every wind of falſe Doctrine.</hi> Now the Apoſtles, and Prophets, and Evangeliſts, and Paſtors, and Doctors, are not the preſent Church; therefore the Church is not the only means for this end, nor that which is here ſpoken of.</p>
                     <p n="80">80. Peradventure by, <hi>he gave,</hi> you conceive, is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, <hi>he promiſed that he would give unto the worlds end.</hi> But what reaſon have you for this conceit? Can you ſhew that the word, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, hath this ſignification in other
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:57896:114"/>places, and that it muſt have it in this place? Or will not this interpretation drive you preſently to this blaſphemous abſurdity, that God hath not performed his promiſe? Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs you will ſay, which for ſhame I think you will not, that you have now, and in all Ages ſince Chriſt have had Apoſtles, and Prophets, and Evangeliſts: for as for Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, and Doctors alone, they will not ſerve the turn. For if God promiſed to give all theſe, then you muſt ſay he hath given all, or elſe that he hath broke his promiſe. Neither may you pretend, that the <hi>Paſtors and Doctors were the ſame with the Apoſtles, and Prophets, and Evangeliſts, and therefore having Paſtors and Doctors, you have all.</hi> For it is apparent, that by theſe names, are denoted ſeveral O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

Anſ.</hi> I hope you will grant, that <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> and <hi>Galen,</hi> and <hi>Euclid,</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtotle,</hi> and <hi>Saluſt,</hi> and Caeſar, and <hi>Livie,</hi> were dead ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Ages ſince; and yet that we are now preſerved from Error by them, in a great part of Phyſick, of Geometry, of Logick, of the <hi>Roman</hi> ſtory. But what if theſe men had writ by divine Inſpiration, and writ compleat bodies of the Sciences they profeſſed, and writ them plainly and perſpicuouſly? You would then have granted, I believe, that their works had been ſufficient to keep us from error, and from diſſention in theſe matters. And why then ſhould it be incongruous to ſay, that the Apoſtles, and Prophets, and Evangeliſts, and Paſtors, and Doctors, which Chriſt gave upon his Aſcenſion, by their writings,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:57896:114"/>which ſome of them writ but all approved, are even now ſufficient means, to conſerve us in Unity of Faith, and guard us from Error? Eſpecially ſeeing theſe writings are, by the confeſſion of all parts, true and divine, and as we pretend and are ready to prove, contain a plain and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Rule of Faith; and as the
<note n="*" place="margin">Perron.</note> Chiefeſt of you acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, <hi>contain immediatly, all the Principal and Fundamental points of Chriſtianity,</hi> referring us to the Church and Tradition only for ſome minute particularities. But tell me I pray, the Biſhops that compoſed the Decrees of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> and the Pope that confirmed them, are they means to conſerve you in Unity, and keep you from Error, or are they not? Peradventure you will ſay, <hi>their Decrees are, but not their Perſons:</hi> but you will not deny I hope, that you owe your unity, and freedom from Error, to the Perſons that made theſe Decrees: neither will you deny, that the writings which they have left behind them, are ſufficient for this purpoſe. And why may not then the Apoſtles writings be as fit for ſuch a purpoſe, as the Decrees of your Doctors? Surely their intent in writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was to conſerve us in unity of Faith, and to keep us from Error, and we are ſure God ſpake in them; but your Doctors from whence they are, we are not ſo cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. Was the Holy Ghoſt then unwilling, or unable to direct them ſo, that their writings ſhould be fit and ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to attain that end they aimed at in writing? For if he were both able and willing to do ſo, then certainly he did do ſo. And then their writings may be very ſufficient means, if we would uſe them as we ſhould do, to preſerve us in unity, in all neceſſary points of Faith, and to guard us from all pernitious Error.</p>

If yet you be not ſatisfied, but will ſtill pretend that, <hi>all theſe words by you cited, ſeem clearly enough to prove, that the Church is Univerſally infallible, without which Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Faith could not be conſerved againſt every wind of Doctrin:</hi> I <hi>Anſ.</hi> That to you, which will not underſtand, that there can be any means to conſerve the unity of Faith, but only that which conſerves your authority over the Faithful, it is no marvel that theſe words ſeem to prove, that the

But we that have no ſuch end, no ſuch deſires, but are willing to leave all men to their liberty, provided they will not improve it to a Tyranny over others, we find it no difficulty to diſcern between <hi>dedit</hi> and <hi>promiſit, he gave at his Aſcenſion,</hi> and <hi>he promiſed to the Worlds end.</hi> Beſides, though you whom it concerns, may happily flatter your ſelves, that you have not only Paſtors, and Doctors, but Prophets, and Apoſtles, and Evangeliſts, and thoſe diſtinct from the former ſtill in your Church; yet we that are diſintereſſed perſons, cannot but ſmile at theſe ſtrange ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations. Laſtly, though you are apt to think your ſelves ſuch neceſſary inſtruments for all good purpoſes, and that nothing can be well done unleſs you do it; that no unity or conſtancy in Religion can be maintained, but inevitably Chriſtendom muſt fall to ruin, and confuſion, unleſs you ſupport it: yet we that are indifferent and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial, and well content, that God ſhould give us his own favours, by means of his own appointment, not of our chooſing, can eaſily collect out of theſe very words, that not the Infallibility of your, or of any Church, but the <hi>Apoſtles, and Prophets, and Evangeliſts,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>which Chriſt gave upon his Aſcenſion,</hi> were deſigned by him, for the compaſſing all theſe excellent purpoſes, by their preaching while they lived, and by their writings for ever. And if they fail hereof, the Reaſon is not any inſufficiency or invalidity in the means, but the voluntary perverſneſs of the Subjects they have to deal with: who, if they would be themſelves, and be content that others ſhould be, in the choice of their Religion the ſervants of God and not of men; if they would allow, that the way to Heaven is no narrower now, than Chriſt left it, his yoak no heavier than he made it; that the belief of no more difficulties, is required now to Salvation, than was in the Primitive Church; that no Error is in it ſelf deſtructive, and excluſive from Salvation now, which was not then; if inſtead of being zealous <hi>Papiſts,</hi> earneſt <hi>Calviniſts,</hi> ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gid <hi>Lutherans,</hi> they would become themſelves, and be content that others ſhould be plain and honeſt Chriſtians;
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:57896:115"/>if all men would believe the Scripture, and freeing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from prejudice and paſſion, would ſincerely endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to find the true ſenſe of it, and live according to it, and require no more of others, but to do ſo; nor denying their Communion to any that do ſo, would ſo order their publick ſervice of God, that all which do ſo may without ſcruple, or hypocriſie, or proteſtation againſt any part of it, joyn with them in it: who does not ſee that (ſeeing as we ſuppoſe here, and ſhall prove hereafter,) all neceſſary Truths, are plainly and evidently ſet down in Scripture, there would of neceſſity be among all men, in all things neceſſary, unity of Opinion? And notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any other differences that are or could be, unity of Communion and Charity and mutual Toleration? By which means, all Schiſm and Hereſie, would be baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the World, and thoſe wretched contentions which now rend and tear in pieces, not the Coat, but the Members and Bowels of Chriſt, which mutual pride and Tyranny, and curſing, and killing, and damning, would fain make immortal, ſhould ſpeedily receive a moſt bleſſed Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtrophe. But of this hereafter, when we ſhall come to the queſtion of Schiſm, wherein I perſwade my ſelf, that I ſhall plainly ſhew, that the moſt vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment accuſers, are the greateſt offenders, and that they are indeed at this time, the greateſt Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, who make the way to Heaven narrower, the yoak of Chriſt heavier, the differences of Faith greater, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of Eccleſiaſtical Communion harder, and ſtricter, than they were made at the beginning by Chriſt and his Apoſtles: they who talk of Unity, but aim at Tyranny, and will have peace with none, but with Slaves and Vaſſals. In the mean while, though I have ſhewed how Unity of Faith, and Unity of Charity too, may be preſerved with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out your Churches Infallibility, yet ſeeing you modeſtly conclude from hence, not that your Church is, but only <hi>ſeems to be</hi> univerſally Infallible, meaning to your ſelf, of which you are a better judge than I: Therefore I willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly grant your concluſion, and proceed.</p>

Whereas you ſay, that <hi>it were great impiety to imagin that God, the lover of Souls, hath left no certain infallible means to decide both this and all other differences ariſing about the interpretation of Scripture, or upon any other occaſion:</hi> I deſire you to take heed, you commit not an impiety in making more impieties than Gods Commandments make. Certainly God is no way obliged either by his promiſe or his love to give us all things, that we may imagine would be convenient for us, as formerly I have proved at large. It is ſufficient that he denies us nothing neceſſary to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. <hi>Deus non deficit in neceſſariis, nec redundat in ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is:</hi> So D. <hi>Stapleton.</hi> But that the ending of all Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, or having a certain means of ending them, is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to Salvation, that you have often ſaid and ſuppoſed, but never proved, though it be the main pillar of your whole diſcourſe. So little care you take how ſlight your foundations are, ſo your building make a fair ſhow. And as little care, how you commit thoſe faults your ſelf, which you condem in others. For you here charge them with great impiety, who imagine that <hi>God the lover of Souls hath left no infallible means to determine all differences ariſing about the interpretation of Scripture, or upon any other occaſion:</hi> And yet afterwards being demanded by D. <hi>Potter, why the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:57896:116"/>between the Jeſuits and Dominicans remain undetermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned?</hi> You return him this croſs interrogatory, <hi>Who hath aſſured you that the point wherein theſe learned men differ, is a revealed Truth, or capable of definition, or is not rather by plain Scripture indeterminable, or by any Rule of Faith?</hi> So then when you ſay, <hi>it were great impiety to imagine that God hath not left infallible means to decide all differences;</hi> I may an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, It ſeems you do not believe your ſelf. For in this controverſie, which is of as high conſequence as any can be, you ſeem to be doubtful whether there be any means to determin it. On the other ſide, when you ask D. <hi>Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, who aſſured him that there is any means to determine this Controverſie?</hi> I anſwer for him, that you have, in calling <hi>it a great impiety to imagine that there is not ſome infallible means to decide this and all other differences ariſing about the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of Scripture, or upon any other occaſion.</hi> For what trick you can deviſe to ſhew that this difference, between the <hi>Dominicans</hi> and <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> which includes a difference about the ſenſe of many Texts of Scripture, and many other matters of moment, was not included under <hi>this and all other differences,</hi> I cannot imagine. Yet if you can find out any, thus much at leaſt we ſhall gain by it, <hi>that gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſpeeches are not always to be underſtood generally, but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with exceptions and limitations.</hi>

But if there be any infallible means to decide all differences, I beſeech you name them. <hi>You ſay it is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult and hear Gods Viſible Church with ſubmiſſive acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of her Infallibility.</hi> But ſuppoſe the difference be (as here it is) <hi>whether your Church be Infallible,</hi> what ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide that? If you would ſay (as you ſhould do) Scripture and Reaſon, then you foreſee that you ſhould be forced to grant that theſe are fit means to decide this Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie, and therefore may be as fit to decide others. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to avoid this, you run into a moſt ridiculous abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and tell us that this difference alſo, whether the Church be Infallible, as well as others, muſt be agreed by <hi>a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſive acknowledgment of the Churches Infallibility.</hi> As if you ſhould have ſaid, My Brethren, I perceive this is a great contention amongſt you, whether the <hi>Roman</hi> Church
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:57896:117"/>be Infallible? If you will follow my advice, I will ſhew you a ready means to end it; you muſt firſt agree that the <hi>Roman</hi> Church is Infallible, and then your contention whether the <hi>Roman</hi> Church be Infallible, will quickly be at an end. Verily a moſt excellent advice, and moſt compendious way of ending all Controverſies, even with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out troubling the Church to determine them! For why may not you ſay in all other differences, as you have done in this? Agree that the <hi>Pope</hi> is ſupream head of the Church: That the ſubſtance of Bread and Wine in the Sacrament is turned into the body, and blood of Chriſt: That the Communion is to be given to Lay-men but in one kind: That Pictures may be worſhipped: That Saints are to be invocated; and ſo in the reſt, and then your differences about the Popes Supremacy, Tranſubſtantiation, and all the reſt will ſpeedily be ended. If you ſay, the advice is good in this, but not in other caſes, I muſt requeſt you not to expect always, to be believed upon your word, but to ſhew us ſome reaſon, why any one thing, namely the Churches Infallibility, is fit to prove it ſelf; and any other thing, by name the Popes Supremacy, or Tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not as fit? Or if for ſhame you will at length con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, that the Churches Infallibility is not fit to decide this difference, whether the Church be infallible, then you muſt confeſs it is not fit to decide all: Unleſs you will ſay, it may be fit to decide all, and yet not fit to decide this, or pretend that this is not comprehended under all. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides if you grant that your Churches infallibility can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not poſſibly be well grounded upon, or decided by it ſelf, then having profeſſed before, that <hi>there is no poſſible means beſides this, for us to agree hereupon,</hi> I hope you will give me leave to conclude, that it is impoſſible upon good ground for us to agree that the <hi>Roman</hi> Church is Infallible. For certainly light it ſelf, is not more clear than the evidence of this ſyllogiſm: If there be no other means to make men agree upon your Churches Infallibility, but only this, and this be no means, then it is ſimply impoſſible for men upon good grounds to agree that your Church is In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible: But there is (as you have granted) no other poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:57896:117"/>means to make men agree hereupon, but only a ſubmiſſive acknowledgment of her Infallibility, And this is apparently no means; Therefore it is ſimply impoſſible for men upon good grounds to agree that your Church is Infallible.</p>

By <hi>Fundamentals</hi> he underſtands <hi>not the Fundamental rules of good Life and Action,</hi> (though every one of theſe is to be believed to come from God, and therefore vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually includes an Article of Faith;) but the Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal <hi>Doctrines of Faith;</hi> ſuch, as though they have influence upon our lives, as every eſſential Doctrine of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity hath, yet we are commanded to believe them, and not to do them. The aſſent of our underſtandings is required to them, but no obedience from our wills.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. But theſe ſpeculative Doctrines again he diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes out of <hi>Aquinas, Occham,</hi> and <hi>Canus</hi> and others, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to two kinds: of the firſt are thoſe which are the <hi>Objects of Faith, in, and for themſelves,</hi> which by their own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Gods prime intention, are eſſential parts of that Goſpel: ſuch as the Teachers in the Church, cannot with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Mortal ſin omit to teach the Learners: ſuch as are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecal to the Covenant between God and Man; and not only plainly revealed by God, and ſo <hi>certain</hi> truths, but alſo commanded to be preacht to all men, and to be believed diſtinctly by all, and ſo <hi>neceſſary truths.</hi> Of the ſecond ſort are <hi>Accidental, Circumſtantial, Occaſional</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of Faith; Millions whereof there are in Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture; ſuch as are to be believed, not for themſelves,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:57896:118"/>but becauſe they are joyned with others, that are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to be believed, and delivered by the ſame Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which delivered theſe. Such as we are not bound to know to be Divine Revelations, (for without any fault we may be Ignorant hereof, nay believe the contrary;) ſuch as we are not bound to examine, whether or no they be Divine Revelations: ſuch as Paſtors are not bound to teach their Flock, nor their Flock bound to know and remember: no nor the Paſtors themſelves to know them, or believe them, or not to disbelieve them abſolutely and always; but then only when they do ſee, and know them to be delivered in Scripture, as Divine Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. I ſay when they do ſo, and not only when they may do. For to lay an obligation upon us of believing, or not disbelieving any Verity, ſufficient Revelation on Gods part, is not ſufficient: For then ſeeing all the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Verities of Scripture are either to all men, or at leaſt to all learned men ſufficiently revealed by God, it ſhould be a damnable ſin, in any learned men actually to disbelieve any one particular Hiſtorical verity contained in Scripture, or to believe the contradiction of it, though he knew it not to be there contained. For though he did not, yet he might have known it; it being plainly reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by God, and this revelation being extant in ſuch a Book, wherein he might have found it recorded, if with dilligence he had peruſed it. To make therefore any points neceſſary to be believed, it is requiſite, that either we actually know them to be Divine Revelations: and theſe though they be not Articles of Faith, nor neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to be believed, in and for themſelves, yet indirectly, and by accident, and by conſequence, they are ſo: The neceſſity of believing them, being inforced upon us, by a neceſſity of believing this Eſſential, and Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Article of Faith, <hi>That all Divine Revelations are true,</hi> which to disbelieve, or not to believe, is for any Chriſtian not only impious, but impoſſible. Or elſe it is requiſite that they be, Firſt actually revealed by God. Secondly, commanded under pain of damnation, to be
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:57896:119"/>particularly known (I mean known to be Divine Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,) and diſtinctly to be believed. And of this latter ſort of ſpeculative Divine Verities, <hi>D. Potter</hi> affirmed, <hi>that the Apoſtles Creed was a ſufficient ſummary:</hi> yet he affirmed it, not as his own opinion, but as the Doctrine of the <hi>Ancient Fathers, and your own Doctors.</hi> And beſides, he affirmed it not as abſolutely certain, but very probable.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. In brief, all that he ſays is this: It is <hi>very probable, that according to the judgment of the</hi> Roman <hi>Doctors, and the Ancient Fathers, the Apoſtles Creed is to be eſteemed a ſufficient ſummary of all thoſe Doctrines which being meerly</hi> Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denda, <hi>and not</hi> Agenda, <hi>all men are ordinarily, under pain of Damnation, bound particularly to believe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="6">6. Now <hi>this aſſertion</hi> (you ſay) <hi>is neither pertinent to the queſtion in hand, nor in it ſelf true.</hi> Your Reaſons to prove it <hi>impertinent,</hi> put into form and diveſted of impertinencies are theſe. 1. <hi>Becauſe the queſtion was not, what points were neceſſary to be explicitely believed, but what points were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsary not to be disbelieeved after ſufficient propoſal. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to give a Catalogue of points, neceſſary to be explicitely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved is impertinent.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="7">7. <hi>Secondly, becauſe Errors may be damnable, though the contrary truths be not of themſelves Fundamental; as that</hi> Pontius Pilate <hi>was our Saviours Judge, is not in it ſelf a Fundamental truth, yet to believe the contrary were a dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Error. And therefore to give a Catalogue of Truths in themſelves Fundamental, is no pertinent ſatisfaction to this demand, what Errors are damnable?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="8">8. <hi>Thirdly, becauſe if the Church be not Univerſally infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible, we cannot ground any certainty upon the Creed, which we muſt receive upon the Credit of the Church: and if the Church be Univerſally Infallible, it is damnable to oppoſe her declaration in any thing, though not contained in the Creed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="9">9. <hi>Fourthly, Becauſe not to believe the Articles of the Creed in the true ſenſe is damnable, therefore it is frivolous to ſay the Creed contains all Fundamentals, without ſpecifying in what ſenſe the Articles of it are Fundamental.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="10">10. <hi>Fifthly, becauſe the Apoſtles Creed</hi> (<hi>as D.</hi> Potter <hi>himſelf confeſſes) was not a ſufficient Catalogue, till it was explained
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:57896:119"/>by the firſt Council; nor then until it was declared in the ſecond,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>by occaſion of emergent Hereſies: Therefore now alſo as new Hereſies may ariſe, it will need particular expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and ſo is not yet, nor ever will be a compleat Catalogue of Fundamentals.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="11">11. Now to the firſt of theſe objections I ſay: Firſt, that your diſtinction between points neceſſary to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, and neceſſary not to be disbelieved, is more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til than ſound, a diſtinction without a difference: There being no point neceſſary to be believed, which is not neceſſary not to be disbelieved: Nor no point to any man, at any time, in any circumſtances neceſſary not to be disbelieved, but it is to the ſame man, at the ſame time, in the ſame circumſtances, neceſſary to be believed. Yet that which (I believe) you would have ſaid, I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge true, that many points which are not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to be believed abſolutely, are yet neceſſary to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved upon a ſuppoſition, that they are known to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed by God: that is, become then neceſſary to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, when they are known to be Divine Revelations. But then I muſt needs ſay, you do very ſtrangly, in ſaying, that <hi>the queſtion was, what points might lawfully be disbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, after ſufficient Propoſition that they are Divine Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi> You affirm, that none may, and ſo does <hi>D. Potter,</hi> and with him all Proteſtants, and all Chriſtians. And how then is this the queſtion? Who ever ſaid or thought, that of Divine Revelations, known to be ſo, ſome might ſafely and lawfully be rejected, and disbelieved, under pretence that they are not Fundamental? which of us ever taught, that it was not damnable, either to deny, or ſo much as doubt of the Truth of any thing, whereof we either know, or believe that God hath revealed it? What Proteſtant ever taught that it was not damnable, either to give God the lie, or to call his Veracity into queſtion? Yet you ſay, <hi>The demand of Charity miſtaken was, and it was moſt reaſonable, that a liſt of Fundamentals, ſhould be given, the denial whereof deſtroys Salvation, whereas the denial of other points may ſtand with Salvation, although both kinds be equally propoſed, as revealed by God.</hi>

                     <p n="12">12. Let the reader peruſe <hi>Charity Miſtaken,</hi> and he ſhall find that this qualification, <hi>although both kinds of points be equally propoſed as revealed by God,</hi> is your ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d no part of the demand. And if it had, it had been moſt unreaſonable, ſeeing he and you know well enough, that (though we do not preſently without examination, fall down and worſhip all your Churches propoſals, as Divine Revelations) yet, we make no ſuch diſtinction of known Divine Revelations, as if ſome on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of them were neceſſary to be believed, and the reſt might ſafely be rejected. So that to demand a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar minute Catalogue of all points that may not be disbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved after ſufficient Propoſition, is indeed to demand a Catalogue of all points that are or may be, in as much as none may be disbelieved, after ſufficient Propoſition, that it is a Divine Revelation. At leaſt it is to deſire us, Frſt, to Tranſcribe into this Catalogue, every Text of the whole Bible. Secondly, to ſet down diſtinctly, thoſe innumerous Millions of negative and poſitive con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences, which may be evidently deduced from it: For theſe we ſay, God hath revealed. And indeed you are not aſhamed in plain terms to require this of us. For having firſt told us, <hi>that the demand was, what points were neceſſary not to be disbelieved, after ſufficient propoſition that they are Divine Truths:</hi> you come to ſay, <hi>Certainly the Creed contains not all theſe.</hi> And this you prove by ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>how many Truths are there in Holy Scripture, not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Creed, which we are not bound to know and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, but are bound under pain of damnation not to reject, as ſcon as we come to know that they are found in Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture?</hi> So that in requiring a particular Catalogue of all points, not to be disbelieved, after ſufficient Propoſal, you require us to ſet you down all points contained in Scripture, or evidently deducible from it. And yet this you are pleaſed to call a <hi>reaſonable,</hi> nay, <hi>a moſt reaſonable Demand:</hi> whereas having ingaged your ſelf to give a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue of your Fundamentals, you conceive your engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment very well ſatisfied by ſaying, <hi>all is Fundamental which the Church propoſes,</hi> without going about, to give us
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:57896:120"/>an endleſs Inventory of her Propoſals. And therefore from us, inſtead of a perfect particular of Divine Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of all ſorts, (of which with a leſs hyperbole than S. <hi>John</hi> uſeth, we might ſay, <hi>If they were to be written, the World would not hold the Books that muſt be written;</hi>) me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks you ſhould accept of this general, All Divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations are true, and to be believed.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. The very truth is, the main Queſtion in this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is not, <hi>what Divine Revelations are neceſsary to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, or not rejected when they are ſufficiently propoſed:</hi> for all without exception, all without queſtion are ſo; But <hi>what Revelations are ſimply and abſolutely neceſſary to be propoſed to the belief of Chriſtians, ſo that that Society, which does propoſe, and indeed believe them, hath for matter of Faith, the eſſence of a true Church; that which does not, has not.</hi> Now to this queſtion, though not to yours, <hi>D. Potter's</hi> aſſertion (if it be true) is apparently very pertinent. And though not a full and total ſatisfaction to it, yet very effectual, and of great moment towards it. For the main queſtion being, what points are neceſſary to Salvation: and points neceſſary to Salvation, being of two ſorts, ſome of <hi>ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple belief,</hi> ſome of <hi>Practice and Obedience,</hi> he that gives you a ſufficient ſummary, of the firſt ſort of neceſſary points, hath brought you half way towards your Journies end. And therefore that which he does, is no more to be ſlighted, as vain and impertinent, than an Architects work is to be thought impertinent towards the making of a Houſe, becauſe he does it not all himſelf. Sure I am, if his aſſertion be true, as I believe it is, a Corollary may preſently be deduced from it, which if it were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced, cannot in all reaſon, but do infinite ſervice, both to the truth of Chriſt, and the peace of Chriſtendom. For ſeeing falſhood and Error could not long ſtand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the power of truth, were they not ſupported by Tyranny and worldly advantages, he that could aſſert Chriſtians to that liberty which Chriſt and his Apoſtles left them, muſt need do Truth a moſt Heroical ſervice. And ſeeing the overvaluing of the differences among Chriſtians, is one of the greateſt maintainers of the
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:57896:121"/>Schiſm of Chriſtendom, he that could demonſtrate that only theſe points of Belief, are ſimply neceſſary to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, wherein Chriſtians generally agree, ſhould he not lay a very fair and firm Foundation of the peace of Chriſtendom? Now the Corollary which I conceive would produce theſe good effects, and which flowes na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally from D. <hi>Potters</hi> Aſſertion, is this, <hi>That what Man or Church ſoever believes the Creed, and all the evident conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of it ſincerely and heartily, cannot poſſibly (if alſo he believe the Scripture) be in any Error of ſimple belief which is offenfive to God; nor therefore deſerve for any ſuch Error to be deprived of his Life, or to be cut off from the Churches Communion, and the hope of Salvation.</hi> And the produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of this again would be this (which highly concerns the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to think of,) <hi>That whatſoever Man or Church does for any Error of ſimple belief, deprive any man ſo quallified as above, either of his temporal life, or live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyhood or liberty, or of the Churches Communion, and hope of Salvation, is for the firſt unjuſt, cruel, and Tyrannous: Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical, preſumptuous, and uncharitable for the ſecond.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="14">14. Neither yet is this (as you pretend) to take away the neceſſity of believing thoſe Verities of Scripture, which are not contained in the Creed, when once we come to know that they are written in Scripture, but rather to lay a neceſſity upon men of believing all things written in Scripture, when once they know them to be there written. For he that believes not all known Divine Revelations to be true, how does he believe in God? Unleſs you will ſay, that the ſame man, at the ſame time may not believe God, and yet believe in him. The greater difficulty is, how it will not take away the neceſſity of believing Scripture to be the Word of God? But that it will not neither. For though the Creed be granted a ſufficient ſummary of <hi>Articles of meer Faith,</hi> yet no man pretends that it contains the <hi>Rules of Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> but for them, all men are referred to Scripture. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, he that pretends to believe in God, obligeth himſelf to believe it neceſſary to obey that which reaſon aſſures him to be the Will of God. Now reaſon will aſſure
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:57896:121"/>him that believes the Creed, that it is the Will of God he ſhould believe the Scripture: even the very ſame Reaſon which moves him to believe the Creed: Univerſal, and never failing Tradition, having given this Teſtimony both to Creed and Scripture, that they both by the works of God were ſealed, and teſtified to be the words of God. And thus much be ſpoken in Anſwer to your firſt Argument; the length whereof will be the more excuſable, If I oblige my ſelf to ſay but little to the reſt.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. I come then <hi>to your ſecond.</hi> And in Anſwer to it, deny flatly, as a thing deſtructive of it ſelf, that any Error can be damnable, unleſs it be repugnant immediatly or mediatly, directly or indirectly, of it ſelf or by accident, to ſome Truth for the matter of it fundamental. And to your example of <hi>Pontius Pilat's being Judge of Chriſt,</hi> I ſay the denial of it in him that knows it to be revealed by God, is manifeſtly deſtructive of this Fundamental truth, that <hi>all Divine Revelations are true.</hi> Neither will you find any Error ſo much as by accident damnable, but the reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting of it will be neceſſarily laid upon us, by a real belief of all Fundamentals, and ſimply neceſſary Truths. And I deſire you would reconcile with this, that which you have ſaid §. 15. <hi>Every Fundamental Error muſt have a contrary Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Truth, becauſe of two Contradictory propoſitions in the ſame degree, the one is falſe, the other muſt be true,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="16">16. <hi>To the Third</hi> I Anſwer; That the certainty I have of the Creed, That it was from the Apoſtles, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the principles of Faith, I ground it not upon Scripture, and yet not upon the Infallibility of any preſent, much leſs of your Church, but upon the Authority of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Church, and written Tradition, which (as D. <hi>Potter</hi> hath proved) gave this conſtant Teſtimony unto it. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides I tell you, it is guilty of the ſame fault which D. <hi>Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s Aſſertion is here accuſed of: having perhaps ſome colour toward the proving it falſe, but none at all to ſhew it impertinent.</p>
                     <p n="17">17. <hi>To the Fourth,</hi> I Anſwer plainly thus, That you find fault with D. <hi>Potter</hi> for his Vertues: you are offended with him for not uſurping the Authority which he hath not; in
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:57896:122"/>a word for not playing the <hi>Pope.</hi> Certainly if <hi>Proteſtants</hi> be faulty in this matter, it is for doing it too much, and not too little. This preſumptuous impoſing of the ſenſes of men upon the words of God, the ſpecial ſenſes of men up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the general words of God, and laying them upon mens conſciences together, under the equal penalty of death, and damnation; this vain conceit that we can ſpeak of the things of God, better than in the word of God: This Deifying our own Interpretations, and Tyrannous infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing them upon others; This reſtraining of the word of God from that latitude and generality, and the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings of men from that liberty, wherein Chriſt and the Apoſtles left them,

                     <p n="18">18. <hi>Your fifth and laſt objection</hi> ſtands upon a falſe and dangerous ſuppoſition: That <hi>new Hereſies may ariſe.</hi> For
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:57896:122"/>an Hereſie being in it ſelf nothing elſe but a Doctrine Repugnant to ſome Article of the Chriſtian Faith, to ſay that new Hereſies may ariſe, is to ſay, that new Articles of Faith may ariſe: and ſo ſome great ones among you ſtick not to profeſs in plain terms, who yet at the ſame time are not aſhamed to pretend that your whole Doctrin is Catholick and Apoſtolick. So <hi>Salmeron: Non omnibus omnia dedit Deus, ut quaelibet aetas ſuis gaudeat verita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibus, quas prior aetas ignoravit.</hi> God hath not given all things to All: So that every age hath its proper Verities, which the former age was ignorant of: <hi>Diſp.</hi> 57. <hi>In Ep. ad Rom.</hi> And again in the Margent: <hi>Habet Unumquod<expan>

                              <ex>que</ex>
                           </expan> ſae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culum peculiares Revelationes Divinas,</hi> Every age hath its peculiar Divine Revelations. Where that he ſpeaks of ſuch Revelations as are, or may by the Church be made mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Faith, no man can doubt that reads him; an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample whereof, he gives us a little before in theſe words. <hi>Unius Auguſtini doctrina Aſſumptionis B. Deiparae cultum in Eccleſiam introduxit.</hi> The Doctrin of <hi>Auguſtin</hi> only, hath brought in to the Church the Worſhip of the Aſſumption of the Mother of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Others again mince and pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liate the matter with this pretence, that your Church un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes not to coyn new Articles of Faith, but only to declare thoſe that want ſufficient declaration. But if ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient declaration be neceſſary to make any Doctrin an Article of Faith, then this Doctrin which before wanted it, was not before an Article of Faith; and your Church by giving it the Eſſential form, and laſt complement of an Article of Faith, makes it, though not a Truth, yet cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly an Article of Faith. But I would fain know, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Chriſt and his Apoſtles knew this Doctrin, which you pretend hath the matter, but wants the form of an Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of Faith, that is, <hi>ſufficient declaration,</hi> whether they knew it to be a neceſſary Article of the Faith, or no! If they knew it not to be ſo: then either they taught what they knew not, which were very ſtrange; or elſe they taught it not: and if not, I would gladly be informed, ſeeing you pretend to no new Revelations from whom you learnt it? If they knew it, then either they concealed or decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:57896:123"/>it. To ſay they concealed any neceſſary part of the Goſpel, is to charge them with far greater Sacriledg, than what was puniſhed in <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira.</hi> It is to charge theſe glorious Stewards, and diſpenſers of the Myſteries of Chriſt, with want of the great vertue requiſite in a Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, which is <hi>Fidelity.</hi> It is to charge them with preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption for denouncing Anathema's, even to Angels, in caſe they ſhould teach any other doctrin, than what they had received from them, which ſure could not merit an Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thema, if they left any neceſſary part of the Goſpel un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taught. It is in a word, in plain terms to give them the lie, ſeeing they profeſs plainly and frequently, that they taught Chriſtians <hi>the whole Doctrin of Chriſt.</hi> If they did know and declare it, then was it a full and formal Article of Faith; and the contrary a full and formal Hereſie, without any need of further declaration: and then their Succeſſors either continued the declaration of it, or diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued: If they did the latter, how are they ſuch faithful depoſitaries of Apoſtolick Doctrin as you pretend? Or what aſſurance can you give us, that they might not bring in new and falſe Articles, as well as ſuffer the old and true ones to be loſt? If they did continue the declaration of it, and deliver it to their Succeſſors, and they to theirs, and ſo on perpetually, then continued it ſtill a full and formal Article of faith, and the repugnant doctrin a full and formal Hereſie, without and before the definition or declaration of a Council. So that Councils, as they cannot make that a truth or falſhood, which before was not ſo: ſo neither can they make or declare that to be an Article of Faith, or an Hereſie, which before was not ſo. The ſuppoſition therefore on which this argument ſtands, being falſe and ruinous, whatſoever is built upon it, muſt together with it fall to the ground. This explication therefore, and reſtricti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this doctrin, (whereof you make your advantage) was to my underſtanding unneceſſary. The Fathers of the Church in after times might have juſt cauſe to declare their judgment, touching the ſenſe of ſome general Articles of the Creed: but to oblige others to receive their declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons under pain of damnation, what warrant they had I
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:57896:123"/>know not. He that can ſhew, either that the Church of all Ages was to have this Authority; or that it continued in the Church for ſome Ages, and then expired: He that can ſhew either of theſe things let him: for my part I cannot. Yet I willingly confeſs the judgment of a Council, though not infallible, is yet ſo far directive and obliging that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out apparent reaſon to the contrary, it may be ſin to reject it, at leaſt not to afford it an outward ſubmiſſion for pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick peace ſake.</p>
                     <p n="20">20. Ad §. 7.8, 9. I come now to ſhew that you alſo have requited D. <hi>Potter</hi> with a mutual courteous acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of his aſſertion, That the Creed is a ſufficient ſummary of all the neceſſary Articles of Faith, which are meerly <hi>Credenda.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="21">21. Firſt then, §. 8. You have theſe words, <hi>That it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denied that the Creed is moſt full and compleat to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, for which the holy Apoſtles, inſpired by God, meant that it ſhould ſerve, and in that manner as they did intend it, which was, not to comprehend all particular points of Faith, but ſuch general heads as were moſt befitting and requiſite for preaching the Faith of Chriſt, to Jews and Gentiles, and might be briefly, and compendiouſly ſet down, and eaſily learnt and remembred.</hi> Theſe words I ſay, being fairly examined, without putting them on the rack, will amount, to a full acknowledgment of D. <hi>Potters</hi> Aſſertion. But before I put them to the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, I muſt crave thus much right of you, to grant me this moſt reaſonable poſtulate, that the doctrin of <hi>repentance from dead works,</hi> which S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, was one of the two only things which he preacht, and the doctrin <hi>of Charity, without which</hi> (the ſame S. <hi>Paul</hi> aſſures us that) <hi>the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of all myſteries, and all faith is nothing,</hi> were doctrins more neceſſary and requiſite, and therefore more fit to be preacht to <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> than theſe, <hi>under what judge our Saviour ſuffered,</hi> that <hi>he was buried,</hi> and <hi>what time he roſe again:</hi> which you have taught us cap. 3. §. 2. <hi>for their matter and nature in themſelves not to be Fundamental.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="22">22. And upon this grant, I will ask no leave to conclude, that, whereas you ſay, <hi>the Apoſtles Creed was intended for a comprehenſion, of ſuch heads of faith, as were moſt befitting
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:57896:124"/>and requiſite, for preaching the faith of Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. You are now, for fear of too much debaſing thoſe high doctrines as Repentance and Charity, to reſtrain your aſſertion, as D. <hi>Potter</hi> does his, (and though you ſpeak indefinitely) to ſay you meant it, only of thoſe heads of faith, which are <hi>meerly Credenda.</hi> And then the meaning of it, (if it have any,) muſt be this, That the Creed is full for the Apoſtles intent, which was to comprehend all ſuch general heads of faith, which being points of <hi>ſimple belief,</hi> were moſt fit and requiſite, to be preached to Jews and Gentiles, and might be briefly and compendiouſly ſet down, and eaſily learned and remembred. Neither I nor you, I believe, can make any other ſence of your words than this. And upon this ground thus I ſubſume. But all the points of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, which were neceſſary, under pain of damnation, for the Apoſtles to preach, and for thoſe to whom the Goſpel was preached, particularly to know and believe, were moſt fit and requiſite, nay more than ſo, neceſſary to be preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to all both Jews and Gentiles, and might be briefly and compendiouſly ſet down, and eaſie learn'd and remembred: therefore the Apoſtles intent by your confeſſion, was in this Creed, to comprehend all ſuch points. And you ſay, <hi>the Creed is moſt full and complete, for the purpoſe which they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.</hi> The Major of this Syllogiſm is your own. The Minor I ſhould think needs no proof, yet becauſe all men may not be of my mind, I will prove it by its parts; and the firſt part thus, There is the ſame neceſſity, for the doing of theſe things, which are commanded to be done, by the ſame Authority, under the ſame penalty: But the ſame Authority, <hi>viz.</hi> Divine, under the ſame penalty, to wit, of damnation, commanded the Apoſtles, to preach all theſe Doctrines which we ſpeak of, and thoſe to whom they were preached, particularly to know and believe them: For we ſpeak of thoſe only, which were ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, to be preached and believed: Therefore all theſe points were alike neceſſary to be preached to all both Jews and Gentiles. Now that all theſe doctrines we ſpeak of, may be briefly and compendiouſly ſet down, and eaſily learned and remembred, he that remembers, that we ſpake
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:57896:124"/>only of ſuch Doctrines as are neceſſary to be taught and learned, will require hereof no farther demonſtration. For, (not to put you in mind of what the Poet ſays, <hi>Non ſunt longa quibus nihil eſt quod demere poſſis,</hi>) who ſees not, that ſeeing the greateſt part of men are of very mean ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities, that it is neceſſary that that may be learnt eaſily, which is to be learn'd of all? What then can hinder me from concluding thus, all the Articles of ſimple belief, which are fit and requiſite to be preached, and may eaſily be remembred, are by your confeſſion comprized in the Creed: but all the neceſſary Articles of Faith are requiſite to be preached, and eaſie to be remembred; therefore they are all comprized in the Creed? Secondly, from grounds granted by you, I argue thus, Points of belief in themſelves fundamental, are more requiſite to be preached than thoſe which are not ſo: (this is evident.) But the Apoſtles have put into their Creed ſome points that are not in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves fundamental: (ſo you confeſs, <hi>ubi ſupra.</hi>) There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if they have put in all, moſt requiſite to be preached, they have put in all, that in themſelves are fundamental. Thirdly and laſtly, from your own words Sect. 26. thus I conclude my purpoſe, <hi>The Apoſtles intention was, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly to deliver in the Creed ſuch Articles as were fitteſt for thoſe times, concerning the Deity, Trinity, and Meſſias;</hi> (thus you, now I ſubſume,) but all points ſimply neceſſary, by vertue of Gods command, to be preached and believed in particular, were as fit for thoſe times as theſe here men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; therefore their intention was, to deliver in it par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly all the neceſſary points of belief.</p>
                     <p n="23">23. And certainly he that conſiders the matter adviſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, either muſt ſay that the Apoſtles were not the Authors of it, or that this was their deſign in compoſing it, or that they had none at all. For whereas you ſay, <hi>their intent was, to comprehend in it ſuch general heads as were moſt beſitting and requiſite for preaching the faith;</hi> and elſewhere, <hi>Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly to deliver ſuch Articles as were fitteſt for thoſe times;</hi> Every wiſe man may eaſily ſee that your deſire here was, to eſcape away in a cloud of indefinite terms. For other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, inſtead of ſuch general heads, and ſuch Articles,
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:57896:125" rendition="simple:additions"/>why did not you ſay plainly, all ſuch, or ſome ſuch? This had been plain dealing, but I fear, croſs to your deſign: which yet you have failed of. For that which you have ſpoken (though you are loath to ſpeak out,) ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſignifies nothing at all; or that which I and D. <hi>Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> affirm: <hi>viz.</hi> That the Apoſtles Creed contains all thoſe points of belief, which were by Gods command, of neceſſity to be preached to all, and believed by all. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther when I ſay ſo, would I be ſo miſtaken, as if I ſaid, that all points in the Creed are thus neceſſary: For Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies in Logick, know that univerſal affirmatives, are not ſimply converted. And therefore it may be true, that all ſuch neceſſary points, are in the Creed; though it be not true, that all points in the Creed are thus neceſſary: which I willingly grant, of the points by you mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But this rather confirms, than any way invalidates my aſſertion. For how could it ſtand with the Apoſtles wiſdom, to put in any points circumſtantial and not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, and at the ſame time, to leave out any that were eſſential and neceſſary for that end, which you ſay they propoſed to themſelves, in making the Creed, that is, <hi>The preaching of the Faith, to Jews and Gentiles?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="31">31. Ad §. 11.12, 13, 14, 15. Obj. <hi>Summaries and Abſtracts are not intended to ſpecifie all the particulars of the ſcience or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to which they belong.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> Yes if they be intended for perfect Summaries, they muſt not omit any neceſſary doctrin of that Science whereof they are Summaries; though the Illuſtration and Reaſons of it they may omit. If this were not ſo, a man might ſet down forty or fifty of the Principal definitions and diviſions, and rules of Logick, and call it a Summary or Abſtract of Logick. But ſure, this were no more a Summary, than that were the picture of a man in little, that wanted any of the parts of a man; or that a total ſum wherein all the particulars were not caſt up. Now the Apoſtles Creed you here intimate that it was intended for a Summary: otherwiſe why talk you here of Su<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maries, and tell us that they need not contain all the particulars of their Science? And of what I pray may it be a
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:57896:125" rendition="simple:additions"/>Summary, but of the Fundamentals of Chriſtian Faith? Now you have already told us, <hi>That it is moſt full and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat to that purpoſe for which it was intended.</hi> Lay all this together, and I believe the product will be; That the Apoſtles Creed is a perfect Summary of the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals of the Chriſtian Faith: and what the duty of a perfect Summary is, I have already told you.</p>
                     <p n="32">32. Whereas therefore to diſprove this Aſſertion, in divers particles of this Chapter, but eſpecially the Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth, you muſter up whole Armies of Doctrines, which you pretend are neceſſary, and not contained in the Creed; I anſwer very briefly thus: That the Doctrines you men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are either concerning matters of practice, and not ſimple belief; or elſe they are ſuch Doctrines wherein God has not ſo plainly revealed himſelf, but that honeſt and good men, true Lovers of God and of Truth, thoſe that deſire above all things to know his will and do it, may Err, and yet commit no ſin at all, or only a ſin of infirmity, and not deſtructive of Salvation; or laſtly, they are ſuch Doctrines which God hath plainly revealed, and ſo are neceſſary to be believed when they are known to be Divine, but not neceſſary to be known and belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, not neceſſary to be known for Divine, that they may be believed. Now all theſe ſorts of Doctrines are impertinent to the preſent Queſtion.</p>
                     <p n="33">33. Firſt, the Queſtions touching the Conditions to be performed by us to obtain remiſſion of ſins; the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; the Commandments, and the poſſibility of keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, the neceſſity of imploring the Aſſiſtance of Gods Grace and Spirit for the keeping of them: how far obedience is due to the Church: Prayer for the Dead: The ceſſation of the Old Law: are all about <hi>Agenda,</hi> and ſo cut off upon the firſt conſideration.</p>
                     <p n="34">34. Secondly, the Queſtion touching Fundamentals, is profitable but not Fundamental. He that believes all Fundamentals, cannot be damned for any Error in Faith, though he believe more or leſs to be Fundamental than is ſo. That alſo of the proceſſion of the Holy Ghoſt from the Father and the Son: of Purgatory: of the Churches
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:57896:126"/>Viſibility: of the Books of the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> which were doubted of by a conſiderable part of the Primitive Church: (until I ſee better reaſon for the contrary than the bare authority of men,) I ſhall eſteem of the ſame condition.</p>
                     <p n="35">35. Thirdly, Theſe Doctrines that <hi>Adam</hi> and the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels ſinned: that there are Angels good and bad: that thoſe Books of Scripture which were never doubted of by any conſiderable part of the Church, are the word of God: that S. <hi>Peter</hi> had no ſuch primacy as you pretend: that the Scripture is a perfect rule of Faith, aad conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently that no neceſſary Doctrine is unwritten: that there is no one Society or ſucceſſion of Chriſtians abſolutely Infallible: Theſe to my underſtanding are truths plainly revealed by God, and neceſſary to be believed by them who know they are ſo. But not ſo neceſſary, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Man and Woman is bound under pain of damnation particularly to know them to be Divine Revelations, and explicitely to believe them. And for this reaſon, theſe with innumerable other points, are to be referred to the third ſort of Doctrines above mentioned, which were never pretended to have place in the Creed. There re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains one only point of all that Army you Muſtred to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, reducible to none of theſe Heads, and that is, that God is, and is a Remunerator, which you ſay is queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the denial of merit. But if there were ſuch a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary indiſſoluble coherence between this point and the Doctrine of merit, methinks with as much reaſon, and more charity you might conclude, That we hold merit, becauſe we hold this point; Then that we deny this point, becauſe we deny merit. Beſide, when <hi>Proteſtants</hi> deny the Doctrine of Merits, you know right well, for ſo they have declared themſelves a thouſand times, that they mean nothing elſe, but with <hi>David,</hi> that <hi>their well doing extendeth not, is not truly beneficial to God:</hi> with our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, <hi>when they have done all which they are commanded, they have done their duty only,</hi> and no courteſie: And laſtly, with S. <hi>Paul,</hi> that <hi>all which they can ſuffer for God</hi> (and yet ſuffering is more than doing) <hi>is not worthy to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:57896:126"/>to the glory that ſhall be revealed.</hi> So that you muſt either miſunderſtand their meaning in denying Merit, or you muſt diſcharge their Doctrine of this odious conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, or you muſt charge it upon <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf. Nay you muſt either grant their denial of true Merit juſt and reaſonable, or you muſt ſay, that our good actions are really profitable to God: that they are not debts already due to him, but voluntary and undeſerved Favours: and that they are equal unto and well worthy of Eternal Glory which is prepared for them. As for the inconvenience which you ſo much fear, That the denial of Merit makes God a giver only, and not a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warder; I tell you, good Sir, you fear where no fear is, and that it is both moſt true on the one ſide, that you in holding good Works meritorious of Eternal Glory make God a rewarder only and not a giver, contrary to plain Scripture, affirming that <hi>The gift of God is Eternal Life;</hi> And that it is moſt falſe on the other ſide, that the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of <hi>Proteſtants</hi> makes God a giver only and not a rewarder: In as much as their Doctrine is, That God gives not Heaven but to thoſe which do ſomething for it, and ſo his gift is alſo a Reward; but withal that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever they do is due unto God beforehand, and worth nothing to God, and worth nothing in reſpect of Heaven, and ſo Mans work is no Merit, and Gods reward is ſtill a Gift.</p>
                     <p n="36">36. Put the caſe the <hi>Pope,</hi> for a reward of your Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice done him in writing this Book, had given you the Honour and means of a Cardinal, would you not, not only in humility but in ſincerity have profeſſed, that you had not merited ſuch a reward? And yet the <hi>Pope</hi> is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther your Creator nor Redeemer, nor Preſerver, nor perhaps your very great Benefactor, ſure I am, not ſo great as God Almighty, and therefore hath no ſuch right and title to your Service as God hath in reſpect of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent obligations. Beſides, the work you have done him hath been really advantagious to him: and laſtly, not altogether unproportionable to the forementioned reward. And therefore if by the ſame work you will pretend that either you have or hope to have deſerved immortal
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:57896:127"/>Happineſs, I beſeech you conſider well whether this be not to ſet a higher value upon a Cardinals Cap, than a Crown of immortal Glory, and with that Cardinal to prefer a part in <hi>Paris</hi> before a part in <hi>Paradiſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="37">37. As for your diſtinction, between Hereſies that have been, and Hereſies that are, and Hereſies that may be, I have already proved it vain; and that whatſoever may be an Hereſie, that is ſo; and whatſoever is ſo, that always hath been ſo, ever ſince the publication of the Goſpel of Chriſt. The Doctrine of your Church may like a Snow-ball increaſe with rouling, and again if you pleaſe melt away and decreaſe: But as <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> ſo his Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, <hi>is yeſterday and to day, and the ſame for ever.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="38">38. Our Saviour ſending his Apoſtles to preach, gave them no other Commiſſion than this: <hi>Go teach all Nations, Baptizing them in the Name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt, teaching them to obſerve all things, whatſoever I have commanded you.</hi> Theſe were the bounds of their Commiſſion. If your Church have any larger, or if ſhe have a Commiſſion at large, to teach what ſhe pleaſes, and call it the Goſpel of Chriſt, let her produce her Letters patents, from Heaven for it. But if this be all you have, then muſt you give me leave to eſteem it both great ſacriledg in you to forbid any thing, be it never ſo ſmall or ceremonious, which Chriſt hath command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: as the receiving of the Communion in both kinds: and as high a degree of preſumption, to enjoyn men to believe, that there are or can be any other Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Articles of the Goſpel of Chriſt, than what Chriſt himſelf commanded his Apoſtles to teach all men; or any damnable Hereſies, but ſuch as are plainly repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to theſe prime Verities.</p>
                     <p n="39">39. Ad §. 16, 17.] The ſaying of the moſt Learned <hi>Prelate</hi> and excellent man the <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Armach</hi> (which ſhall be ſet down at the end of <hi>N.</hi> 43.) is as great and as good a Truth, and as neceſſary for theſe miſerable times as can poſſibly be uttered: For this is moſt certain, and I believe you will eaſily grant it, that to reduce Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to Unity of Communion, there are but two ways
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:57896:127"/>that may be conceived probable: The one, by taking away diverſity of opinions touching matters of Religion: The other by ſhewing that the diverſity of Opinions, which is among the ſeveral Sects of Chriſtians, ought to be no hindrance to their Unity in Communion.</p>
                     <p n="40">40. Now the former of theſe is not to be hoped for without a miracle, unleſs that could be done, which is impoſſible to be performed, though it be often pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended; that is, unleſs it could be made evident to all men, that God hath appointed ſome viſible Judge of Controverſies, to whoſe judgment all men are to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit themſelves. What then remains, but that the other way muſt be taken, and Chriſtians muſt be taught to ſet a higher value upon theſe high points of Faith and obedience wherein they agree, than upon theſe matters of leſs moment wherein they differ, and underſtand that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement in thoſe, ought to be more effectual to joyn them in one Communion, than their difference in other things of leſs moment to divide them? When I ſay, <hi>in one Communion,</hi> I mean, in a common Profeſſion of thoſe articles of Faith, wherein all conſent: A joynt worſhip of God, after ſuch a way as all eſteem lawful; and a mutual performance of all thoſe works of Charity, which Chriſtians owe one to another. And to ſuch a Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what better inducement could be thought of, than to demonſtrate that what was Univerſally believed of all Chriſtians, if it were joyned with a love of truth, and with holy obedience, was ſufficient to bring men to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven? For why ſhould men be more rigid than God? Why ſhould any Error exclude any man from the Churches Communion, which will not deprive him of Eternal Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation? Now that Chriſtians do generally agree in all thoſe points of Doctrine, which are neceſſary to Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it is apparent, becauſe they agree with one accord, in believing all thoſe Books of the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> which in the Church were never doubted of to be the undoubted Word of God. And it is ſo certain that in all theſe Books, all neceſſary Doctrines are evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contained, that of all the four Evangeliſts this is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:57896:128"/>probable, but of S. <hi>Luke</hi> moſt apparent, that in every one of their Books they have comprehended the whole ſubſtance of the Goſpel of Chriſt. For what reaſon can be imagined, that any of them ſhould leave out any thing which he knew to be neceſſary, and yet (as apparently all of them have done) put in many things which they knew to be only profitable and not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary? What wiſe and honeſt man that were now to write the Goſpel of Chriſt, would do ſo great a work of God after ſuch a negligent faſhion? Suppoſe <hi>Xaverius</hi> had been to write the Goſpel of Chriſt for the <hi>Indians,</hi> think you he would have left out any Fundamental Doctrine of it? If not, I muſt beſeech you to conceive as well of S. <hi>Matthew,</hi> and S. <hi>Mark,</hi> and S. <hi>Luke,</hi> and S. <hi>John,</hi> as you do of <hi>Xaverius.</hi> Beſides, if every one of them have not in them all neceſſary Doctrines, how have they complied with their own deſign, which was, as the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles of their Books ſhew, to write <hi>the Goſpel of Chriſt,</hi> and not a part of it? Or how have they not deceived us, in giving them ſuch Titles? By the whole Goſpel of Chriſt, I underſtand not the whole Hiſtory of Chriſt, but all that makes up the Covenant between God and Man. Now if this be wholly contained in the Goſpel of Saint <hi>Mark</hi> and Saint <hi>John,</hi> I believe every conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing man will be inclinable to believe that then with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt, it is contained, with the advantage of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other very profitable things, in the larger Goſpels of Saint <hi>Matthew,</hi> and Saint <hi>Luke.</hi> And that Saint <hi>Marks</hi> Goſpel wants no neceſſary Article of this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, I preſume you will not deny, if you believe <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus</hi> when he ſays, <hi>Matthew to the</hi> Hebrews <hi>in their Tongue publiſhed the Scripture of the Goſpel: When</hi> Peter <hi>and</hi> Paul <hi>did Preach the Goſpel, and found the Church or a Church at</hi> Rome, <hi>or of</hi> Rome, <hi>and after their departure</hi> Mark <hi>the Scholar of</hi> Peter, <hi>delivered to us in writing thoſe things which had been Preached by</hi> Peter; <hi>and</hi> Luke, <hi>the follower of</hi> Paul, <hi>compiled in a Book the Goſpel which was Preached by him: And afterwards</hi> John, <hi>reſiding in</hi> Aſia, <hi>in the City of</hi> Ephſeus, <hi>did himſelf alſo ſet forth a Goſpel.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="247" facs="tcp:57896:128"/>
                     <p n="41">41. In which words of <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> it is remarkable that they are ſpoken by him againſt ſome Hereticks,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 2.</note> that pretended (as you know who do now adaies) that <hi>ſome ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Doctrines of the Goſpel were unwritten,</hi> and that <hi>out of the Scriptures, truth</hi> (he muſt mean ſufficient truth,) <hi>cannot be found by thoſe which know not Tradition.</hi> Againſt whom to ſay, that part of the Goſpel which was Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by S <hi>Peter</hi> was written by S <hi>Mark,</hi> and ſo other neceſſary parts of it omitted, had been to ſpeak imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinently, and rather to confirm than confute their Error. It is plain therefore, that he muſt mean, as I pretend, that all the neceſſary Doctrine of the Goſpel, which was Preached by Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> was written by Saint <hi>Mark.</hi> Now you will not deny, I preſume, that Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all, therefore you muſt not deny that S. <hi>Mark</hi> wrote all.</p>
                     <p n="42">42. Our next inquiry let it be touching S. <hi>Johns</hi> intent in writing his Goſpel, whether it were to deliver ſo much truth, as being believed and obeyed would certainly bring men to Eternal Life, or only part of it, and to leave part unwritten? A great man there is, but much leſs than the Apoſtle, who ſaith, that <hi>writing laſt, he purpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſupply the defects of the other Evangeliſts, that had wrote before him:</hi> which (if it were true) would ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently juſtifie what I have undertaken, that at leaſt all the four Evangeliſts have in them, all the neceſſary parts of the Goſpel of Chriſt. Neither will I deny, but S. <hi>Johns</hi> ſecondary intent might be to ſupply the defects of the former three Goſpels, in ſome things very profitable. But he that pretends, that any neceſſary Doctrine is in S. <hi>John</hi> which is in none of the other Evangeliſts, hath not ſo well conſidered them as he ſhould do, before he pronounce ſentence of ſo weighty a matter. And for his prime intent in writing his Goſpel, what that was, certainly no Father in the World underſtood it better than himſelf. Therefore let us hear him ſpeak: <hi>Many other ſigns</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>alſo did Jeſus in the ſight of his Diſciples, which are not written in this Book: But theſe are written, that you may believe that Jeſus is Chriſt the Son of God, and that believing you may have Life in his name.</hi>
                        <pb n="248" facs="tcp:57896:129"/>By <hi>(theſe are written)</hi> may be underſtood, either <hi>theſe things</hi> are written, or <hi>theſe ſigns</hi> are written. Take it which way you will, this concluſion will certainly follow, That either all that which S. <hi>John</hi> wrote in his Goſpel, or leſs than all, and therefore all much more was ſufficient to make them believe that which being believed with live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Faith, would certainly bring them to Eternal Life.</p>
                     <p n="43">43. This which hath been ſpoken (I hope) is enough to juſtifie my undertaking to the full, that it is very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that every one of the four Evangeliſts has in his Book the whole ſubſtance, all the neceſſary parts of the Goſpel of Chriſt. But for Saint <hi>Luke,</hi> that he hath written ſuch a perfect Goſpel, in my judgment it ought to be with them that believe him, no manner of queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Conſider firſt the introduction to his Goſpel, where he declares what he intends to write, in theſe Words, <hi>For as much as many have taken in hand to ſet forth in order a Declaration of thoſe things, which are moſt ſurely believed amongſt us, even as they delivered unto us, which from the beginning were Eye-witneſſes, and Miniſters of the Word, it ſeemed good to me alſo, having had perfect un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of things from the firſt, to write to thee in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, moſt excellent</hi> Theophilus, <hi>that thou mighteſt know the certainty, of thoſe things wherein thou haſt heen inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.</hi> Add to this place, the entrance to his <hi>Hiſtory of the</hi> Acts <hi>of the Apoſtles: The former Treatiſe have I made,</hi> O The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ophilus, <hi>of all that Jeſus began both to do and teach, until the day in which he was taken up.</hi> Weigh well theſe two places, and then anſwer me freely and ingenuouſly to theſe demands. 1. Whether S. <hi>Luke</hi> does not undertake the very ſame thing which he ſays, <hi>many had taken in hand?</hi> 2. Whether this were not <hi>to ſet forth in order, a Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of thoſe things which are moſt ſurely believed amongſt Chriſtians?</hi> 3. Whether the whole Goſpel of Chriſt, and every neceſſary Doctrine of it, were not ſurely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved among Chriſtians? 4. Whether they which were <hi>Eye-witneſſes and Miniſters of the Word from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, delivered not the whole Goſpel of Chriſt?</hi> 5. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he does not undertake to write in order theſe
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:57896:129"/>things <hi>whereof he had perfect underſtanding</hi> from the firſt? 6. Whether he had not perfect underſtanding of the whole Goſpel of Chriſt? 7. Whether he doth not undertake to write to <hi>Theophilus</hi> of all thoſe things <hi>wherein he had been inſtructed?</hi> 8. And whether he had not been inſtructed in all the neceſſary parts of the Goſpel of Chriſt? 9. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the other Text, <hi>All things which Jeſus began to do and teach,</hi> muſt not at leaſt imply, all the principal and neceſſary things? 10. Whether this be not the very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of your <hi>Rhemiſh</hi> Doctors, in their Annotation upon this place? 11. Whether all theſe Articles of the Chriſtian Faith, without the belief whereof, no man can be ſaved, be not the principal and moſt neceſſary things which <hi>Jeſus</hi> taught? 12. And laſtly, whether many things which S. <hi>Luke</hi> has wrote in his Goſpel, be not leſs principal, and leſs neceſſary than all and every one of theſe? When you have well conſidered theſe propoſals, I believe you will be very apt to think (if S. <hi>Luke</hi> be of cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit with you) That all things neceſſary to ſalvation, are certainly contained in his writings alone. And from hence you will not chooſe but conclude, that ſeeing all the Chriſtians in the world, agree in the belief of what S. <hi>Luke</hi> hath written, and not only ſo, but in all other Books of Canonical Scripture, which were never doubted of in and by the Church, the Learned Arch-Biſhop had very juſt, and certain ground to ſay, <hi>That in theſe Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which without Controverſie are univerſally received in the whole Chriſtian world, ſo much truth is contained, as being joyned with holy obedience, may be ſufficient to bring a man to everlaſting Salvation; and that we have no cauſe to doubt, but that as many as walk according to this rule, neither over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwing that which they have builded, by ſuperinducing any damnable Hereſie thereupon, nor otherwiſe vitiating their holy faith, with a lewd and wicked converſation, peace ſhall be upon them, and upon the Iſrael of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="44">44. Againſt this, you object two things. The one, that by this Rule, <hi>ſeeing the Doctrin of the Trinity is not recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved univerſally among Chriſtians, the denial of it ſhall not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude Salvation.</hi> The other, that the <hi>Biſhop contradicts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:57896:130"/>in ſuppoſing a man may believe all neceſſary Truths, and yet ſuperinduce ſome damnable Hereſies.</hi>

To the firſt I anſwer, what I conceive he would, whoſe words I here juſtify, that he hath declared plainly in this very place, that he meant, not an abſolute, but a limited Univerſality, and ſpeaks not of propoſitions uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally believed by all Profeſſions of Chriſtianity that are, but only, by all thoſe ſeveral Profeſſions of Chriſtianity, that have any large ſpread in <hi>any part of the world.</hi> By which words he excludes from the univerſality here ſpoken of, the denyers of the Doctrin of the Trinity, as being but a handful of men, in reſpect of all, nay in reſpect of any of theſe profeſſions which maintain it. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was a great fault in you, either willingly to conceal theſe words, which evacuate your objection, or elſe negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently to overſee them.</p>
                     <p n="46">46. Now for the foul Contradiction, wherein I pray does it lie? <hi>In ſuppoſing</hi> (ſay you) <hi>a man may believe all Truths neceſſary to ſalvation, and yet ſuperinduce a damnable Hereſie.</hi> I anſwer, It is not certain that his words do ſuppoſe this: neither if they do, does he contradict himſelf. I ſay it is not certain that his words import any ſuch matter. For ordinarily men uſe to ſpeak and write ſo as here he does, when they intend not to limit or reſtrain, but only to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat and preſs and illuſtrate what they have ſaid before.</p>
                     <p>S. <hi>Athanaſius</hi> in his Creed tells us, <hi>The Catholick Faith is this, that we worſhip one God in Trinity, and Trinity in Unity, neither confounding the Perſons nor dividing the Subſtance;</hi> and why now do you not tell him that he contradicts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and ſuppoſes that we may worſhip a Trinity of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and one God in ſubſtance, and yet confound the Perſons, or divide the Subſtance; which yet is impoſſible, becauſe Three remaining Three, cannot be confounded, and One remaining One cannot be divided? If a man ſhould ſay unto you, he that keeps all the Commandments of God, committing no ſin either againſt the love of God, or the love of his neighbour, is a perfect man: Or thus, he that will live in conſtant health had need be exact in his diet, neither eating too much, nor too little: Or thus, he
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:57896:130"/>that will come to <hi>London</hi> muſt go on ſtraight forward in ſuch a way, und neither turn to the right hand or to the left; I verily believe you would not find any contradiction in his words, but confeſs them as coherent and conſonant as any in your Book. And certainly if you would look upon this ſaying of the Biſhop with any indifference, you would eaſily perceive it to be of the very ſame kind, and capable of the very ſame conſtruction. And therefore one of the grounds of your accuſation is uncertain; Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can you aſſure us, that the Biſhop ſuppoſes any ſuch matter as you pretend. Neither if he did ſuppoſe this (as perhaps he did) were this to contradict himſelf. For though there can be no damnable Hereſie, unleſs it contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict ſome neceſſary Truth, yet there is no contradiction but the ſame man may at once believe this Hereſie and this Truth; becauſe there is no contradiction that the ſame man, at the ſame time, ſhould believe contradictions. For, firſt, whatſoever a man believes true, that he may and muſt believe; but there have been ſome who have belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and taught that contradictions might be true, againſt whom <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> diſputes in the third of his <hi>Metaphyſicks;</hi> Therefore it is not impoſſible that a man may believe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions. Secondly, they which believe there is no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty in Reaſon, muſt believe that contradictions may be true: For otherwiſe there will be certainty in this Reaſon; This contradicts Truth, therefore it is falſe. But there be now divers in the world who believe there is no certainty in reaſon, (and whether you be of their mind or no, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to be informed;) Therefore there be divers in the world who believe contradictions may be true. Thirdly, They which do captivate their underſtandings to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of thoſe things which to their underſtanding ſeem ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reconcileable contradictions, may as well believe real contradictions: (For the difficulty of believing ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes not from their being repugnant, but from their ſeeming to be ſo:) But you do captivate your underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to the belief of thoſe things which ſeem to your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings irreconcileable contradictions; therefore it is as poſſible and eaſie for you to believe thoſe that indeed
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:57896:131"/>are ſo. Fourthly, ſome men may be confuted in their Errors, and perſwaded out of them; but no mans Error can be confuted, who together with his Error doth not believe and grant ſome true principle that contradicts his Error: for nothing can be proved to him who grants no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, neither can there be (as all men know) any ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal diſcourſe but out of grounds agreed upon by both parts. Therefore it is not impoſſible but abſolutely certain, that the ſame man at the ſame time may believe contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. Fifthly, It is evident, neither can you without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream madneſs and uncharitableneſs, deny, that we believe the Bible, thoſe Books I mean which we believe Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal: Otherwiſe why diſpute you with us out of them, as out of a common Principle? Either therefore you muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract your opinion, and acknowledge that the ſame man at the ſame time may believe contradictions, or elſe you will run into a greater inconvenience, and be forced to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, that no part of our Doctrin contradicts the Bible. Sixthly, I deſire you to vindicate from contradiction theſe following Aſſertions: That there ſhould be Length, and nothing long: Breadth, and nothing broad: Thickneſs, and nothing thick: Whiteneſs, and nothing white: Round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and nothing round: Weight, and nothing heavy: Sweetneſs, and nothing ſweet: Moiſture, and nothing moiſt: Fluidneſs, and nothing flowing: many Actions, and no Agent: many Paſſions, and no Patient: That is, that there ſhould be a long, broad, thick, white, round, heavy, ſweet, moiſt, flowing, active, paſſive, nothing! That Bread ſhould be turned into the ſubſtance of Chriſt, and yet not any thing of the Bread become any thing of Chriſt; neither the matter, nor the form, nor the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents of Bread, be made either the matter or the Form, or the Accidents of Chriſt. That Bread ſhould be turned into nothing, and at the ſame time with the ſame action turned into Chriſt, and yet Chriſt ſhould not be nothing. That the ſame thing at the ſame time ſhould have its juſt dimenſions, and juſt diſtance of its parts, one from another, and at the ſame time not have it, but all its parts together in one and the ſelf ſame point. That the body of
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:57896:131"/>Chriſt, which is much greater, ſhould be contained whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and in its full dimenſions without any alteration, in that which is leſſer, and that not once only, but as many times over as there are ſeveral points in the bread and wine. That the ſame thing at the ſame time ſhould be wholly above it ſelf, and wholly below it ſelf, within it ſelf, and without it ſelf, on the right hand, and on the left hand, and round about it ſelf. That the ſame thing at the ſame time ſhould move to and from it ſelf, and lie ſtill: Or that it ſhould be carried from one place to another through the middle ſpace, and yet not move. That it ſhould be brought from Heaven to Earth, and yet not come out of Heaven, nor be at all in any of the middle ſpace between Heaven and Earth. That to be one, ſhould be to be undivided from it ſelf, and yet that one and the ſame thing ſhould be divided from it ſelf. That a thing may be, and yet be no where. That a Finite thing may be in all places at once. That a Body may be in a place, and have there its dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and colour, and all other qualities, and yet that it is not in the power of God to make it viſible, and tangi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble there, nor capable of doing or ſuffering any thing. That there ſhould be no certainty in our ſenſes, and yet that we ſhould know ſomething certainly, and yet know nothing but by our ſenſes. That that which is, and was long ago, ſhould now begin to be. That that is now to be made of nothing, which is not nothing but ſomething. That the ſame thing ſhould be before and after it ſelf. That it ſhould be truly and really in a place, and yet without Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cality. Nay, that He which is Omnipotent ſhould not be able to give it Locality in this place, where it is, as ſome of you hold: or if he can, as others ſay he can, that it ſhould be poſſible, that the ſame man, for example You or I, may at the ſame time, be awake at <hi>London,</hi> &amp; not awake but aſleep at <hi>Rome:</hi> There run or walk, here not run or walk, but ſtand ſtill, ſit, or lie along: There ſtudy or write, here do neither, but dine or ſup: There ſpeak, here be ſilent. That he may in one place freez for cold, in another burn with heat. That he may be drunk in one place, and ſober in another: Valiant in one place, and a Coward in another:
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:57896:132"/>A thief in one place, honeſt in another. That he may be a <hi>Papiſt</hi> and go to <hi>Maſs</hi> in <hi>Rome;</hi> A <hi>Proteſtant</hi> and go to Church in <hi>England.</hi> That he may die in <hi>Rome,</hi> and live in <hi>England:</hi> or dying in both places may go to Hell from <hi>Rome,</hi> and to Heaven from <hi>England.</hi> That the Body and Soul of Chriſt ſhould ceaſe to be where it was, and yet not go to another place, nor be deſtroyed. All theſe, and many other of the like nature are the unavoidable, and moſt of them the acknowledged conſequences of your do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ct<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     <p n="49">49. The firſt untruth is, that <hi>ſome Proteſtants make a Church, of men ſcarcely agreeing in one point of faith; of men concurring in ſome one or few Articles of belief, and in the reſt holding conceits plainly contradictory: agreeing only in this one Article, that Chriſt is our Saviour;</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> This is a ſhameleſs Calumny; becauſe even theſe men to the conſtituting of the very eſſence of a Church, in the loweſt degree, require not only <hi>Faith in Jeſus Chriſt the Son of God and Saviour of the World,</hi> but alſo <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to his Doctrin in mind and will.</hi> Now I beſeech you Sir, tell me ingenuouſly, whether the Doctrin of Chriſt may be called without blaſphemy, <hi>ſcarcely one point of Faith?</hi> Or whether it conſiſts only, <hi>of ſome-one or few Articles of belief?</hi> Or whether there be nothing in it, but only this Article, <hi>That Chriſt is our Saviour?</hi> Is it not manifeſt to all the world, that Chriſtians of all Profeſſions do agree with one conſent, in the belief of all thoſe Books of Scripture,
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:57896:132"/>which were not doubted of in the ancient Church, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out danger of damnation? Nay is it not apparent, that no man at this time, can without hypocriſie, pretend to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in Chriſt, but of neceſſity he muſt do ſo? Seeing he can have no reaſon to believe in Chriſt, but he muſt have the ſame to believe the Scripture. I pray then read over the Scripture once more, or if that be too much labour, the New Teſtament only: and then ſay whether there be nothing there, but <hi>ſcarcely one point of Faith? But ſome one or two Articles of belief? Nothing but this Article only, that Chriſt is our Saviour?</hi> Say whether there be not there an infinite number of Divine Verities, Divine pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, Divine promiſes, and thoſe ſo plainly and undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly delivered, that if any ſees them not, it cannot be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he cannot, but becauſe he will not! So plainly, that whoſoever ſubmits ſincerely to the Doctrin of Chriſt, in mind and will, cannot poſſibly but ſubmit to theſe in act and performance. And in the reſt, which it hath pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed God, for reaſons beſt known to himſelf, to deliver obſcurely or ambiguouſly, yet thus far at leaſt they agree, that the ſenſe of them intended by God, is certainly true, and that they are without paſſion or prejudice to endeavor to find it out: The difference only is, which is that true ſenſe which God intended. Neither would this long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, if the walls of ſeparation, whereby the Divel hopes to make their Diviſions eternal, were pulled down; and Error were not ſupported againſt Truth, by human ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages. But for the preſent, God forbid the matter ſhould be ſo ill as you make it! For whereas you looking upon their points of difference and agreement, through I know not what ſtrange glaſſes, have made the firſt innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable, and the other ſcarce a number: the Truth is clean contrary; that thoſe divine Verities, Speculative and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical, wherein they univerſally agree (which you will have to be but a few, or but one, or ſcarcely one) amount to <hi>many millions,</hi>

Yet I would not be ſo miſtaken, as if I thought the Errors even of ſome <hi>Proteſtants</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable things, and matters of no moment. For the truth is, I am very fearful, that ſome of their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, either as they are, or as they are apt to be miſtak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, (though not of themſelves ſo damnable, but that good and holy men may be ſaved with them, yet) are too fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent occaſions of our remiſsneſs, and ſlackneſs, in run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the race of Chriſtian Perfection, of our deferring Repentance, and converſion to God, of our frequent relapſes into ſin, and not ſeldom of ſecurity in ſinning; and conſequently, though not certain cauſes, yet too fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent occaſions of many mens damnation: and ſuch I conceive all theſe Doctrines which either directly or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely, put men in hope of Eternal happineſs, by any other means ſaving only the narrow way <hi>of ſincere and Univerſal obedience,</hi> grounded upon a true and lively Faith. Theſe Errors therefore, I do not elevate or extenuate: and on condition the ruptures made by them might be compoſed, do heartily wiſh, that the cement were made of my deareſt Blood, and only not to be an <hi>Anathema</hi> from Chriſt!

I had always thought, that all contradictions had been equally contradictions, and equally repugnant; becauſe the leaſt of them are as far aſunder, as <hi>Eſt</hi> and <hi>Non Eſt</hi> can make them, and the greateſt are no farther. But then you in your differences, (by name, about Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determination, the Immaculate Conception, the <hi>Popes</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility,) upon what other motive do you rely?

For aſſurance of the Truth hereof, he would adviſe him to rely upon that which all Wiſe Men, in all matters of belief rely upon; and that is, the conſent of Ancient records, and Univerſal Tradition. No Wiſe Man doubts but there was ſuch a man as <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> or <hi>Cicero,</hi> that there are ſuch Cities as <hi>Rome</hi> or <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> though he have no other aſſurance for the one or the other, but only the <hi>ſpeech</hi> of People. This Tradition therefore he would counſel him to rely upon, and to believe that the Book which we call Scripture, was confirmed abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the Works of God, to be the Word of God. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving it the Word of God, he muſt of neceſſity believe it true: and if he believe it true, he muſt believe it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains all neceſſary directions unto Eternal Happineſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it affirms it ſelf to do ſo. Nay he might tell him, that ſo far is the whole Book, from wanting any neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary direction to his Eternal Salvation, that one only Author, that hath writ but two little Books of it, Saint <hi>Luke</hi> by name in the beginning of his <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and in the beginning of his <hi>Story,</hi> ſhews plainly that he alone hath written at leaſt ſo much as is neceſſary. And what they wrote, they wrote by Gods direction, for the direction fo the World, not only for the Learned, but for all that would do their true endeavour to know the will of God, and to do it; therefore you cannot but conceive, that writing to all and for all, they wrote ſo as that in things neceſſary they might be underſtood by all. Beſides that,
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:57896:134"/>here he ſhould find, that God himſelf has engaged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by promiſe, that if he would love him, and keep his Commandments, and pray earneſtly for his Spirit, and be willing to be directed by it, he ſhould undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly receive it, even the <hi>Spirit of Truth which ſhall lead him into all Truth;</hi> that is certainly, into all neceſſary Truths, and ſuffer him to fall into no pernitious Error. The ſum of his whole direction to him briefly would be this, Believe the Scripture to be the Word of God, uſe your true endeavour to find the true ſenſe of it, and to live according to it, and then you may reſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely that you are in the true way to Eternal Happineſs. This is the ſubſtance of that Anſwer which the Doctor would make to any man in this caſe; and this is a way ſo plain, that Fools, unleſs they will, cannot Err from it.

And I pray be not offended with me for ſo eſteeming it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe as before I told you, if you will believe all the points of the Creed, you cannot chooſe but believe all the points of it that are Fundamental, though you be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant which are ſo, and which are not ſo. Now I believe your deſire to know which are Fundamentals, proceeds
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:57896:135"/>only from a deſire to be aſſured that you do believe them; which ſeeing you may be aſſured of, without knowing which they be, what can it be but curioſity to deſire to know it? Neither may you think to mend your ſelf herein one whit by having recourſe to them whom we call <hi>Papiſts;</hi> for they are as far to ſeek as we in this point, which of the Articles of the Creed are, for their nature and mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Fundamental, and which are not. Particularly, you will ſcarce meet with any amongſt their Doctors, ſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturous, as to tell you for a certain, whether or no the conception of Chriſt by the Holy Ghoſt, his being born of a Virgin, his Burial, his deſcent into Hell, and the Communion of Saints, be points of their own nature and matter Fundamental. Such I mean, as without the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct and explicite knowledge of them no man can be ſaved.</p>
                     <p n="63">63. <hi>Obj.</hi> We give this certain Rule, <hi>that all points defined by Chriſts Viſible Church, belong to the Foundation of Faith, in this ſenſe, that to deny any ſuch, cannot ſtand with Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>

                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> So alſo Proteſtants give you this more certain rule, That whoſoever believes heartily thoſe Books of Scripture, which all the Chriſtian Churches in the World acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to be Canonical, and ſubmits himſelf indeed to this, as to the rule of his belief, muſt of neceſſity believe all things Fundamental, and if he live according to his Faith, cannot fail of Salvation. But beſides, what certainty have you, that that rule of <hi>Papiſts</hi> is ſo certain? By the viſible Church it is plain, they mean only their own: and why their own only ſhould be the Viſible Church, I do not underſtand: and as little, why all points defined by this Church ſhould belong to the Foundation of Faith. Theſe things you had need ſee well and ſubſtantially pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, before you rely upon them, otherwiſe you expoſe your ſelf to danger of imbracing damnable Errors inſtead of Fundamental Truths.</p>
                     <p n="67">67. Ad §. 23, 24, 25.] <hi>D. P.</hi> demands, <hi>How it can be neceſſary for any Chriſtian, to have more in his Creed than the Apoſtles bad.</hi> And this he enforces with many Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:57896:136"/>thus. <hi>May the Church of after Ages make the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row way to heaven, narrower than our Saviour left it? Shall it be a fault to ſtraiten and encomber the Kings high way with publick nuiſances; and is it lawful by adding new Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles to the Faith, to retrench any thing from the Latitude of the King of Heavens high way to Eternal happineſs? The Yoak of Chriſt, which he ſaid was eaſie, may it be juſtly made hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier by the Governors of the Church in after Ages? The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles profeſs they revealed to the Church the whole Counſel of God, keeping back nothing needful for our Salvation. What Tyranny then to impoſe any new unneceſſary matters on the Faith of Chriſtians, eſpecially</hi> (<hi>as the late</hi> Popes <hi>have done</hi>) <hi>under the high commanding form,</hi> Qui non crediderit, dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabitur? <hi>He that believeth not, ſhall be damned. If this may be done, why then did our Saviour reprehend the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees ſo ſharply, for binding heavy burdens, and laying them on mens ſhoulders? And why did he teach them, that in vain they worſhiped God, teaching for Doctrines mens Traditions? And why did the Apoſtles call it tempting of God, to lay thoſe things upon the Necks of Chriſtians, that were not neceſſary?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="68">68. All which interrogations ſeem to me to contain ſo many plain and convincing Arguments of the premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Aſſertion; and if you can deviſe no fair and ſatisfying anſwer to them, then be ſo ingenuous as to grant the Concluſion, <hi>That no more can be neceſſary for Chriſtians to believe now, than was in the Apoſtles time.</hi> A concluſion of great importance, for the deciding of many Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies, and the disburdening of the Faith of Chriſt from many incumbrances.</p>
                     <p n="70">70. The Doctor to make good this concluſion argues further thus, S. <hi>Paul</hi> declared to the <hi>Epheſians</hi> the whole Counſel of God touching their Salvation. Therefore that which S. <hi>Paul</hi> did not declare, can be no part of the Counſel of God, and therefore not neceſſary. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; S. <hi>Paul</hi> kept back nothing from the <hi>Epheſians</hi> that was profitable; Therefore he taught them all things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to Salvation.</p>
                     <p n="71">71. Neither is it material, that theſe words were par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly directed by S. <hi>Paul,</hi> to the Paſtours of the Church:
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:57896:136"/>For (to ſay nothing that the point here iſſuable, is not, Whom he taught, whether Prieſts or <hi>Laymen?</hi> But how much he taught, and whether all things neceſſary?) it appears plainly out of the Text, and I wonder you ſhould read it ſo negligently as not to obſerve it, that though he ſpeaks now to the Paſtors, yet he ſpeaks of what he taught not only them, but alſo the Laity as well as them. I <hi>have kept back nothing</hi> (ſays S. <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>that was profitable, but have ſhewed, and have taught you publickly, and from Houſe to Houſe; Teſtifying</hi> (I pray obſerve) <hi>both to the</hi> Jews, <hi>and alſo to the</hi> Greeks <hi>Repentance towards God, and Faith towards our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And a little after, <hi>I know that ye all, among whom I have gone Preaching the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, ſhall ſee my Face no more: Wherefore I take you to record this day, that I am Innocent from the Blood of all men; for I have kept nothing back, but have ſhewed you all the Counſel of God.</hi> And again, <hi>Remember that by the ſpace of three Years I ceaſed not to warn every one Night and Day with Tears.</hi> Certainly though he did all theſe things to the Paſtors among the reſt, nay above the reſt, yet without Controverſie, they whom he taught publickly, and from Houſe to Houſe: The <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Greeks</hi> to whom he <hi>Teſtified</hi> (i. e.) <hi>Preached</hi> Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance: Thoſe all, amongſt whom he went preaching the Kingdom of God: Thoſe, Every one, whom for three Years together he warned, were not Biſhops and Paſtors only.</p>
                     <p n="72">72. Neither is this to ſay, that the Apoſtles taught Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians nothing but their Creed, nothing of the Sacraments, Commandments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for that is not here the point to be proved: but only, that they taught them all things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, ſo that nothing can be neceſſary which they did not teach them. But how much of this they put into their Creed, whether <hi>all the neceſſary points of ſimple belief,</hi> as we pretend, or only as you ſay, <hi>I know not what,</hi> is another Queſtion now to be examined.</p>
                     <p n="73">73. We urge againſt you, <hi>That if all neceſſary points of ſimple belief be not comprized in the Creed, it can no way de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the name of the Apoſtles Creed, as not being their Creed in any ſenſe, but only a part of it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="264" facs="tcp:57896:137"/>
                     <p>To this you ſay, <hi>That the Faith of the Apoſtles is of larg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er extent, than their Creed.</hi> Anſwer, It is very true that their whole Faith was of a larger extent, but that was not the Queſtion; but whether all points of ſimple belief which they taught as neceſſary to be explicitely believed, be not contained in it? And if thus much at leaſt of Chriſtian Religion be not comprized in it, I again de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire you to inform me how it could be called the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles Creed?</p>
                     <p n="74">74. To other Reaſons grounded upon the practice of the Ancient Church; appointing her Infants to be inſtructed (for matters of ſimple belief,) only in the Creed: From her admitting Catechumens unto Baptiſm: and of Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers unto her Communion, upon their only profeſſion of the Creed, you have not, that I perceive, thought fit to make any kind of anſwer.</p>
                     <p n="75">75. Ad §. 26.] In this Section you practiſe that trick of a Caviller, which is to anſwer Objections by other Objections; an excellent way to make Controverſies endleſs! D. <hi>Potter</hi> deſires to be reſolved, <hi>Why amongſt many things of equal ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity to be believed, the Apoſtles ſhould diſtinctly ſet down ſome in the Creed, and be altogether ſilent of others?</hi> Inſtead of reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him in this difficulty, you put another to him, and that is, <hi>Why are ſome points not Fundamental expreſſed in it, rather than others of the ſame quality?</hi> Which demand is ſo far from ſatisfying the former doubt, that it makes it more intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate. For upon this ground it may be demanded, How was it poſſible that the Apoſtles ſhould leave out any Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles ſimply neceſſary, and put in others not neceſſary, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially if their intention were (as you ſay it was) to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver in it ſuch Articles as were fitteſt for thoſe times? Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs (which were wondrous ſtrange) unneceſſary Articles were fitter for thoſe times, than neceſſary. But now to your Queſtion, the Anſwer is obvious: Theſe unneceſſary things might be put in, becauſe they were circumſtances of the neceſſary, <hi>Pontius Pilate</hi> of Chriſts paſſion, The third day of the Reſurrection; neither doth the adding of them make the Creed ever a whit the leſs probable, the leſs fit
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:57896:137"/>to be underſtood, and remembred. And for the contrary reaſons, other unneceſſary things might be left out. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, who ſees not that the addition of ſome unneceſſary circumſtances is a thing that can hardly be avoided with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out affection! And therefore not ſo great a fault, nor deſerving ſuch a cenſure, as the omiſſion of any thing eſſential to the work undertaken, and neceſſary to the end propoſed in it.</p>
                     <p n="76">76. You demand again (as it is no hard matter to multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply demands,) <hi>why our Saviours deſcent into Hell, and Burial was expreſſed, and not his circumciſion, his manifeſtation to the three Kings, and working of Miracles?</hi> I anſwer: His Reſurrection, Aſcenſion, and ſitting at the right hand of God, are very great Miracles, and they are expreſſed. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, S. <hi>John</hi> aſſures us, <hi>That the Miracles which Chriſt did, were done and written not for themſelves that they might be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved,</hi> but for a further end, that <hi>we might believe that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus was the Chriſt, and believing have eternal life.</hi> He therefore that believes this may be ſaved, though he have no explicite and diſtinct Faith of any Miracle that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour did. His Circumciſion and Manifeſtation to the Wiſe men (for I know not upon what grounds you call them <hi>Kings</hi>) are neither things ſimply neceſſary to be known, nor have any near relation to thoſe that are ſo. As for his Deſcent into Hell, it may (for ought you know) be put in as a thing neceſſary of it ſelf to be known. If you ask why more than his Circumciſion, I refer you to the Apoſtles for an anſwer, who put that in, and left this out of their Creed: and yet ſure, were not ſo <hi>forgetful af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the receiving of the Holy Ghoſt, as to leave out any prime and principal foundation of the faith,</hi> which are the very words of your own <hi>Gordonius Huntlaeus, Cont.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 10. <hi>num.</hi> 10. Likewiſe his Burial was put in perhaps as neceſſary of it ſelf to be known. But though it were not, yet hath it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly ſo neer relation to theſe that are neceſſary, (his Paſſion and Reſurrection, being the Conſequent of the one, and the Antecedent of the other,) that it is no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel if for their ſakes it was put in. For though I verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that there is no neceſſary point of this nature, but
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:57896:138"/>what is in the Creed, yet I do not affirm, becauſe I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not prove it, that there is nothing in the Creed but what is neceſſary. You demand thirdly, <hi>Why did they not expreſs Scriptures, Sacraments, and all Fundamental points of faith tending to practice, as well as thoſe which reſt in Belief?</hi> I anſwer; Becauſe their purpoſe was to comprize in it only thoſe neceſſary points which reſt in belief: which appears, becauſe of practical points there is not in it ſo much as one.</p>
                     <p n="77">77. We affirm, That if your Doctrin were true, this ſhort Creed, <hi>viz. I believe the Roman Church to be Infallible,</hi> would have been better, that is, more effectual to keep the believers of it from Hereſie, and in the true Faith, than this Creed which now we have. A propoſition ſo evident, that I cannot ſee how either you, or any of your Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or indeed any ſenſible man can from his heart deny it. Yet becauſe you make a ſhew of doing ſo, or elſe, which I rather hope, do not rightly apprehend the force of the Reaſon, I will endeavour briefly to add ſome light and ſtrength to it, by comparing the effects of theſe ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſuppoſed Creeds.</p>
                     <p n="78">78. The former Creed therefore would certainly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce theſe effects in the believers of it: An impoſſibility of being in any formal Hereſie: A neceſſity of being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared in mind to come out of all Error in Faith, or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Hereſie; which certainly you will not deny, or if you do, you pull down the only pillar of your Church and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and deny that which is in effect the only thing you labour to prove through your whole Book.</p>
                     <p n="79">79. The latter Creed which now we have, is ſo uneffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual for theſe good purpoſes, that you your ſelf tell us of innumerable, groſs, damnable Hereſies, that have been, are, and may be, whoſe contrary Truths are neither ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly, nor by conſequence comprehended in this Creed: So that no man by the belief of this Creed without the former, can be poſſibly guarded from falling into them, and continuing obſtinate in them. Nay, ſo far is this Creed from guarding them from theſe miſchiefs, that it is more likely to enſnare them into them, by ſeeming and
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:57896:138"/>yet not being a full comprehenſion of all neceſſary points of Faith: which is apt (as experience ſhews,) to miſguide men into this pernitious error, That believing the Creed, they believe all neceſſary points of faith, whereas indeed they do not ſo. Now upon theſe grounds I thus conclude: That Creed which hath great commodities and no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, would certainly be better then that which hath great danger, and wants many of theſe great commodities; But the former ſhort Creed propoſed by me, <hi>I believe the Roman Church to be Infallible,</hi> (if your doctrin be true,) is of the former condition, and the latter, that is, the Apoſtles Creed, is of the latter, Therefore the former (if your doctrin be true) would without controverſie be better than the latter.</p>
                     <p n="83">83. Whereas you ſay, <hi>If the Apoſtles had expreſt no Article but that of the Catholick Church, ſhe muſt have taught us the other Articles in particular by Creeds, or other means:</hi> This is very true, but no way repugnant to the truth of this which follows, that the Apoſtles (if your do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin be true) had done better ſervice to the Church, though they had never made this Creed of theirs which now we have, if inſtead thereof, they had commanded in plain terms that for mens perpetual direction in the faith, this ſhort Creed ſhould be taught all men, <hi>I believe the Roman Church ſhall be for ever Infallible.</hi> Yet you muſt not ſo miſtake me, as if I meant, that they had done better not to have taught the Church the ſubſtance of Chriſtian Religion; for then the Church not having learnt it of them, could not have taught it us. This therefore I do not ſay: but ſuppoſing they had written theſe Scriptures as they have written, wherein all the Articles of their Creed are plainly delivered, and preached that Doctrin which they did preach, and done all other things as they have done, beſides the compoſing their Symbol: I ſay, if your doctrin were true, they had done a work infinitely more beneficial to the Church of Chriſt, if they had never compoſed their Symbol, which is but an imperfect com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of the neceſſary points of ſimple belief, and no diſtinctive mark (as a Symbole ſhould be) between thoſe that are good Chriſtians, and thoſe that are not ſo; but
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:57896:139"/>inſtead thereof, had delivered this one Propoſition, which would have been certainly effectual for all the aforeſaid good intents and purpoſes, <hi>The Roman Church ſhall be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Infallible in all things, which ſhe propoſes as matters of Faith.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="84">84. Whereas you ſay, <hi>If we will believe we have all in the Creed, when we have not all, it is not the Apoſtles fault but our own:</hi> I tell you plainly, if it be a fault, I know not whoſe it ſhould be but theirs. For ſure it can be no fault in me to follow ſuch Guides whether ſoever they lead me: Now I ſay, they have led me into this perſwaſion, becauſe they have given me great reaſon to believe it, and none to the contrary. The reaſon they have given me to believe it, is, becauſe it is apparent and confeſt, they did propoſe to themſelves in compoſing it, ſome good end or ends: As <hi>that Chriſtians might have a form, by which</hi> (for matter of Faith) <hi>they might profeſs themſelves Catholicks, So</hi> Putean <hi>out of</hi> Thomas Aquinas: <hi>That the faithful might know, what the Chriſtian people is to believe explicitly, So</hi> Vincent Filiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius: <hi>That being ſeparated into divers parts of the world, they might preach the ſame thing: And that that might ſerve as a mark to diſtinguiſh true Chriſtians from Infidels, So Cardinal</hi> Richlieu. Now for all theſe and for any other good intent, I ſay, it will be plainly uneffectual, unleſs it contain at leaſt all points of ſimple belief, which are in ordinary courſe, neceſſary to be explicitly known by all men. So that if it be a fault in me to believe this, it muſt be my fault to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Apoſtles, wiſe and good men: which I cannot do if I believe not this. And therefore what <hi>Richardus de ſancto Victore</hi> ſays of God himſelf, I make no ſcruple at all to apply to the Apoſtles, and to ſay, <hi>Si error eſt quod cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do, à vobis deceptus ſum:</hi> If it be an Error which I believe, it is you, and my reverend eſteem of you and your actions that hath led me into it. For as for your ſuſpicion, <hi>That we are led into this perſwaſion, out of a hope that we may the better maintain by it ſome opinions of our own,</hi> It is plainly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable. I know no opinion I have, which I would not as willingly forſake as keep, if I could ſee ſufficient reaſon to induce me to believe, that it is the will of God I
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:57896:139"/>ſhould forſake it. Neither do I know any opinion I hold againſt the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> but I have more evident grounds than this whereupon to build it. For let but theſe Truths be granted: That the authority of the Scripture is independent on your Church, and dependent only in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of us upon univerſal Tradition; That Scripture is the only Rule of Faith: That all things neceſſary to ſalvation are plainly delivered in Scripture: Let I ſay theſe moſt certain and divine Truths be laid for foundations, and let our ſuperſtructions be conſequent and coherent to them; and I am confident Peace would be reſtored, and Truth maintained againſt you, though the Apoſtles Creed were not in the world.</p>

For they which alter without neceſſary cauſe the preſent govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of any ſtate Civil or Eccleſiaſtical, do commit a great fault; whereof notwithſtanding they may be inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent who continue this alteration, and to the utmoſt of their power oppoſe a change though to the former ſtate, when continuance of time hath once ſetled the preſent. Thus have I known ſome of your own Church condemn the Low-country-men who firſt revolted from the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> of the ſin of Rebellion, yet abſolve them from it who now being of your Religion there, are yet faithful maintainers of the common liberty againſt the pretences of the King of <hi>Spain.</hi>

Which that it was S. <hi>Auſtins</hi> mind, it is moſt evident out of the 21. c. of
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:57896:141"/>the ſame book: where to <hi>Parmenian</hi> demanding, <hi>how can a man remain pure, being joyned with thoſe that are corrupted?</hi> He anſwers, <hi>Very true, this is not poſſible, if he be joyned with them, that is, if he commit any evil with them, or favour them which do commit it. But if he do neither of theſe, he is not joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with them.</hi> And preſently after, <hi>theſe two things retained, will keep ſuch men pure and uncorrupted; that is, neither doing ill, nor approving it.</hi> And therefore ſeeing you impoſe upon all men of your Communion, a neceſſity of <hi>doing</hi> or at leaſt <hi>approving</hi> many things unlawful, certainly there lies upon us an unavoidable neceſſity of dividing U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, either with you, or with God; and whether of theſe is rather to be done, be ye judges.</p>

What is this to the Viſibility of the Church? May not the Church be Inviſible, and yet theſe that are of it profeſs their Faith? No, ſay you: Their profeſſion will make them viſible.

As a Common-wealth though never ſo far collapſed and overrun with diſorders, is yet in poſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of being reduced unto its Original State, ſo long as the Ancient Laws, and Fundamental Conſtitutions are extant, and remain inviolate, from whence men may be directed how to make ſuch a Reformation. <hi>But S.</hi> Auſtin <hi>urges this very Argument againſt the</hi> Donatiſts, <hi>and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is good.</hi> I anſwer, that I doubt much of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, and my Reaſon is, becauſe you your ſelves ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that even general Councils (and therefore much more particular Doctors) though Infallible in their deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations, are yet in their Reaſons and Arguments, whereupon they ground them, ſubject to like Paſſions and Errors with other men.</p>

And if you liked not this definition, I might deſire you to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form me in thoſe many Schiſms, which have happened in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which of the parts was the Church, and which was divided from it. But to let this paſs, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly your conſequence is moſt unreaſonable.

Certainly Sir, you have forgot your Metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicks, which you ſo much glory in, if you know not, that the connexions of eſſentiall predicates with their ſubjects, are Eternal, and depend not at all upon the actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al exiſtence in the thing defined. This Definition there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of Schiſm, concludes not the exiſtence of a Church, even when it is defined: much leſs the perpetual conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of it, and leaſt of all the continuance of it in perpetual viſibility and purity, which is the only thing that we deny, and you are to prove.</p>

For whereas you take for granted as an undoubted Truth, <hi>That whoſoever leave the external Communion of the viſible Church, are Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical,</hi> I tell you Sir, you preſume too much upon us, and would have us grant, that which is the main point in Queſtion. For either you ſuppoſe the external Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Church corrupted, and that there was a neceſſity for them, that would Communicate with this Church, to Communicate in her corruptions: Or you ſuppoſe her Communion uncorrupted. If the former, and yet will take for granted, that all are Schiſmaticks, that leave her Communion though it be corrupted, you beg the Queſtion in your propoſition. If the latter, you beg the Queſtion in your ſuppoſition, for <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> you know, are Peremptory and Unanimous in the Deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al of both theſe things: Both that the Communion of the Viſible Church, was then uncorrupted; And that they are truly Schiſmaticks, who leave the Communion of the Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church, if corrupted; eſpecially, if the caſe be ſo (and <hi>Luthers</hi> was ſo) that they muſt either leave her Communion
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:57896:145"/>or of neceſſity Communicate with her in her corruptions.</p>
                     <p n="26">26. Beſides although it were granted Schiſm, to leave the external Communion of the Viſible Church in what ſtate or caſe ſo ever it be, and that <hi>Luther</hi> and his follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers were Schiſmaticks, for leaving the external Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all Viſible Churches: yet you fail exceedingly of clearing the other neceſſary point undertaken by you, <hi>That the Roman Church was then the Viſible Church.</hi> For nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do <hi>Proteſtants</hi> (as you miſtake) <hi>make the true preaching of the Word, and due adminiſtration of the Sacraments, the notes of the Viſible Church,</hi> but only of a Viſible Church: now theſe you know are very different things, the former ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying <hi>the Church Catholick,</hi> or the whole Church: the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a <hi>Particular Church,</hi> or a part of the Catholick. And therefore ſuppoſe out of courteſie, we ſhould grant, what by argument you can never evince, that your Church had theſe notes, yet would it by no means follow, that your Church were <hi>the Viſible Church,</hi> but only <hi>a Viſible Church:</hi> not the whole Catholick, but only a part of it.</p>
                     <p n="27">27. Laſtly, whereas <hi>you ſay, that</hi> Proteſtants <hi>muſt either grant that your Church then was the Viſible Church, or name ſome other, diſagreeing from yours and agreeing with</hi> Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants <hi>in their particular doctrin, or acknowledge there was no Viſible Church.</hi> It is all one as if (to uſe S. <hi>Pauls</hi> ſimilitude) the head ſhould ſay to the foot, either you muſt grant that I am the whole body, or name ſome other member that is ſo, or confeſs that there is no body. To which the foot might anſwer; I acknowledge there is a body: and yet, that no member beſide you is this body: nor yet that you are it, but only a part of it. And in like manner ſay we. We acknowledge a Church there was, corrupted indeed univerſally, but yet ſuch a one as we hope by Gods graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous acceptance, was ſtill a Church. We pretend not to name any one Society that was this Church, and yet we ſee no reaſon, that can enforce us to confeſs that yours was the Church but only a part of it, and that one of the worſt then extant in the World. In vain therefore have you troubled your ſelf in proving, that we <hi>cannot pretend, that either the Greeks, Waldenſes, Wickliffites, Huſſites, Muſcovites, Armenians,
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:57896:145"/>Georgians, Abyſſines, were then the Viſible Church.</hi> For all this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe proceeds from a falſe &amp; vain ſuppoſition, and begs another point in Queſtion between us, which is, that <hi>ſome Church of one denomination and one Communion</hi> (as the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> the <hi>Greek,</hi> &amp;c.) <hi>muſt be always,</hi> excluſively to all other Communions, <hi>the whole Viſible Church.</hi> And though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ſome weak <hi>Proteſtant</hi> having this falſe principle ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in him, that there was to be always ſome Viſible Church of one denomination, pure from all error in doctrin, might be wrought upon, and prevailed with by it, to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake the Church of <hi>Proteſtants:</hi> yet why it ſhould induce him to go to yours, rather than the <hi>Greek</hi> Church, or any other, which pretends to perpetual ſucceſſion as well as yours, that I do not underſtand; unleſs it be for the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon which <hi>Aeneas Sylvius</hi> gave, why more held the Pope above a Council, than a Council above the Pope: which was becauſe <hi>Popes did give Biſhopricks, and Archbiſhopricks, but Councils gave none,</hi> and therefore ſuing in <hi>Forma Paupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,,</hi> were not like to have their cauſe very well maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. For put the caſe, I ſhould grant of meer favour, that there muſt be always ſome Church of one Denomination and Communion, free from all errors in doctrin, and that Proteſtants had not always ſuch a Church: it would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low indeed from thence, that I muſt not be a Proteſtant: But that I muſt be a Papiſt, certainly it would follow by no better conſequence than this; if you will leave <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> you muſt of neceſſity go to <hi>Rome.</hi> And yet with this wretched fallacy, have I been ſometimes abuſed my ſelf, and known many other poor ſouls ſeduced, not only from their own Church and Religion, but unto yours. I beſeech God to open the eyes of all that love the truth, that they may not always be held captive, under ſuch miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable deluſions.</p>
                     <p n="28">28. Let us come now to the Arguments which you build upon D. <hi>Potters</hi> own words, out of which you promiſe unanſwerable reaſons to convince Proteſtants of Schiſm.</p>
                     <p n="29">29. But theſe reaſons will eaſily be anſwered, if the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der will take along with him theſe three ſhort Memoran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dums.</p>

                     <p n="31">31. Secondly, That impoſing upon men under pain of Excommunication a neceſſity of profeſſing known er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, and practiſing known corruptions, is a ſufficient and neceſſary cauſe of ſeparation, and that this is the cauſe the Proteſtants alledge to juſtifie their ſeparation from which Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>

                     <p n="32">32. Thirdly, That to leave the Church, and to leave the external Communion of a Church, is not the ſame thing: That being done by ceaſing to be a member of it, by ceaſing to have thoſe requiſites which conſtitute a man a member of it, as faith and obedience: This by refuſing to communicate with any Church in her Liturgies and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick worſhip of God. This Armour if it be rightly placed, will repel all thoſe Batteries which you threaten us with all.</p>
                     <p n="33">33. Ad §. 13.14, 15.] The firſt is a ſentence of S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi> againſt <hi>Donatus,</hi> applied to <hi>Luther</hi> thus. <hi>If the Church periſhed, what Church brought forth</hi> Donatus, (<hi>you ſay</hi> Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?) <hi>If ſhe could not periſh, what madneſs moved the ſect of</hi> Donatus <hi>to ſeparate, upon pretence to avoid the Communion of bad men?</hi> Whereunto, one fair anſwer (to let paſs many others) is obvious out of the ſecond obſervation: That this ſentence though it were Goſpel, as it is not, is imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinently applied to <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Lutherans.</hi> Whoſe pretence of ſeparation (be it true or be it falſe, was not (as that of the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi>) only to avoid the Communion of bad men: but to free themſelves from a neceſſity (which but by ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating was unavoidable,) of joyning with bad men in their impieties.</p>
                     <p n="34">34. Ad §. 16. Your ſecond onſet drives only at thoſe <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> who <hi>hold the true Church was inviſible for many ages.</hi> Which Doctrin (if by the <hi>true Church</hi> be underſtood, the <hi>pure Church,</hi> as you do underſtand it) is a certain truth, &amp; it is eaſier for you to declaim (as you do) than to diſpute againſt it. But <hi>theſe men you ſay muſt be Hereticks becauſe they ſeparated from the Communion of the Viſible Church: and
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:57896:146"/>therefore alſo from the Communion of that which they ſay was inviſible: In as much as the inviſible Church communicated with the viſible.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="35">35. <hi>Anſ.</hi> I might very juſtly deſire ſome proof of that which ſo confidently you take for granted: That, there were no perſecuted and oppreſſed maintainers of the Truth in the days of our Fore-fathers, but only ſuch as diſſembled their opinions, and lived in your Communion. And truly if I ſhould ſay there were many of this condition, I ſuppoſe I could make my Affirmative much more proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, than you can make your Negative. We read in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, that <hi>Elias</hi> conceived <hi>there was none left beſides him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the whole Kingdom of Iſrael,</hi> who had not revolted from God: and yet God himſelf aſſures us that he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. And if ſuch a man, a Prophet, and one of the greateſt, erred in his judgment touching his own time, and his own Country, why may not you, who are certainly but a man, and ſubject to the ſame paſſions as <hi>Elias</hi> was, miſtake in thinking, that in former ages, in ſome Countrey or other, there were not always ſome good Chriſtians, which did not ſo much as externally bow their knees to your <hi>Baal?</hi> But this anſwer I am content you ſhall take no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of, and think it ſufficient to tell you, that if it be true, that this ſuppoſed inviſible Church did hypocritically com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with the viſible Church, in her corruptions, then <hi>Proteſtants</hi> had cauſe, nay neceſſity, to forſake their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion alſo, for otherwiſe they muſt have joyned with them in the practice of impieties: and ſeeing they had ſuch cauſe to ſeparate, they preſume their ſeparation cannot be Schiſmatical.</p>
                     <p n="36">36. Yes, you reply, <hi>to forſake the external Communion of them with whom they agree in faith, is the moſt formal and proper ſin of Schiſm. Anſw.</hi> Very true, but I would fain know <hi>wherein.</hi> I would gladly be informed, whether I be bound for fear of Schiſm, to communicate with thoſe that believe as I do, only in lawful things, or abſolutely in every thing; whether I am to joyn with them in Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Idolatry, and not only in a common profeſſion of the Faith wherein we agree, but in a common diſſimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:57896:147"/>or abjuration of it. This is that which you would have them do, or elſe, forſooth, they muſt be Schiſmaticks. But hereafter I pray remember, that there is no neceſſity of communicating even with true Believers in wicked acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Nay that there is a neceſſity herein to ſeparate from them. And then I dare ſay, even you being their judge, the reaſonableneſs of their cauſe to ſeparate ſhall, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to my firſt obſervation, juſtifie their ſeparation from being Schiſmatical.</p>
                     <p n="37">37. Arg. <hi>But the property of Schiſm according to D.</hi> Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>is to cut off from the hope of ſalvation, the Church from which it ſeparates: And theſe Proteſtants have this property, therefore they are Schiſmaticks.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="38">38. <hi>Anſ.</hi> I deny the Syllogiſm, it is no better than this: One Smptom of the Plague is a Feaver, but ſuch a man hath a Feaver, therefore he hath the Plague. The true concluſion which iſſues out of theſe Premiſſes, ſhould be this. Therefore he hath one Symptom of the plague. And ſo likewiſe in the former, therefore they have one property or one quality of Schiſmaticks. And as in the former inſtance, The man that hath one ſign of the plague, may by reaſon of the abſence of other requiſites, not have the plague: So theſe Proteſtants may have ſomething of Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks, and yet not be Schiſmaticks. A Tyrant ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing a man to death for his pleaſure, and a juſt judge that condemns a malefactor, do both ſentence a man to death, and ſo for the matter do both the ſame thing: yet the one does wickedly, the other juſtly. What's the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon? becauſe the one hath cauſe, the other hath not. In like manner Schiſmaticks, either always or generally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce damnation to them from whom they ſeparate. The ſame do theſe Proteſtants, &amp; yet are not Schiſmaticks. The Reaſon: becauſe Schiſmaticks do it, and do it without cauſe, and Proteſtants have cauſe for what they do. The impieties of your Church, being, generally ſpeaking, dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, unleſs where they are excuſed by ignorance, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piated at leaſt by a general repentance. In fine, though perhaps it may be true, that all Schiſmaticks do ſo yet univerſal affirmatives are not converted, and therefore it
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:57896:147"/>follows not by any good Logick, that all that do ſo, when there is juſt cauſe for it, muſt be Schiſmaticks. The cauſe in this matter of ſeparation is all in all, and that for ought I ſee, you never think of. But <hi>if theſe rigid Proteſtants have juſt cauſe to cut off your Church from the hope of ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: How can the milder ſort allow hope of ſalvation to the Members of this Church? Anſ.</hi> Diſtinguiſh the quality of the Perſons cenſured, and this ſeeming repugnance of their cenſures will vaniſh into nothing. For your Church may be conſidered either in regard of thoſe, in whom, either negligence, or pride, or worldly fear, or hopes, or ſome other voluntary ſin, is the cauſe of their ignorance, which I fear is the caſe of the generality of men amongſt you: or in regard of thoſe who owe their Errors from Truth, to want of capacity, or default of inſtruction; either in reſpect of thoſe that might know the truth and will not, or of thoſe who would know the truth but (all things conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered) cannot: In reſpect of thoſe that have eyes to ſee, and will not ſee, or thoſe that would gladly ſee, but want eyes, or light. Conſider the former ſort of men, (which your more rigid cenſures ſeem eſpecially to reflect upon,) and the heavieſt ſentence will not be too heavy. Conſider the latter, and the mildeſt will not be too mild. So that here is no difference but in words only, neither are you flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered by the one, nor uncharitably cenſured by the other.</p>
                     <p n="39">39. Your next blow is directed againſt the milder ſort of Proteſtants, <hi>who you ſay involve themſelves in the ſin of Schiſm by communicating with thoſe (as you call them) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminating Spirits, whom you conceive your ſelf to have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Schiſmaticks:</hi> And now load them further with the crime of Hereſie. For, ſay you, <hi>if you held your ſelves obliged under pain of damnation, to forſake the Communion of the</hi> Roman <hi>Church by reaſon of her Errors, which yet you confeſs were not fundamental: ſhall it not be much more dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, to live in confraternity with theſe, who defend an Error of the failing of the Church, which in the</hi> Donatiſts <hi>you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs to have been properly Heretical?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="40">40. <hi>Anſ.</hi> You miſtake in thinking that Proteſtants hold themſelves obliged not to communicate with you, only or
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:57896:148"/>principally by reaſon of your Errors and Corruption. For the true reaſon according to my third obſervation, is not ſo much becauſe you <hi>maintain</hi> Errors and Corruptions, as becauſe you <hi>impoſe</hi> them: and will allow your Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to none but to thoſe that will hold them with you; and have ſo ordered your Communion, that either we muſt communicate with you in theſe things, or nothing. And for this very reaſon, though it were granted, that theſe Proteſtants held this Doctrin which you impute to them; And though this Error were as damnable and as much againſt the Creed as you pretend: Yet after all this, this diſparity between you and them, might make it more lawful for us to communicate with them than you: becauſe what they hold, they hold to themſelves, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe not (as you do) to communicate with them that hold the contrary.</p>
                     <p n="41">41. Thus we may anſwer your Argument, though both your former Suppoſitions were granted, But then for a ſecond anſwer, I am to tell you that there is no neceſſity of granting either of them. For neither do theſe Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants hold the failing of the Church from its being, but only from its viſibility: which if you conceive all one, then muſt you conceive that the Stars fail every day, and the Sun every night. Neither is it certain that the Doctrin of the Churches failing is repugnant to the Creed. For as the truth of the Article of the Remiſſion of ſins, depends not upon the actual remiſſion of any mans ſins, but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Gods readineſs and reſolution to forgive the ſins of all that believe and repent; ſo that, although unbelief or impenitence ſhould be univerſal, and <hi>the Faithful ſhould</hi> abſolutely <hi>fail from the children of men,</hi> and <hi>the ſon of man ſhould find no faith on the earth,</hi> yet ſhould the Article ſtill continue true, that God would forgive the ſins of all that repent: In like manner, it is not certain that the truth of the Article of the Catholick Church depends upon the actual exiſtence of a Catholick Church, but rather upon the right, that the Church of Chriſt, or rather (to ſpeak properly) the Goſpel of Chriſt hath to be univerſally believed. And therefore the Article may be true, though
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:57896:148"/>there were no Church in the world. In regard, this not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, it remains ſtill true that there ought to be a Church, and this Church ought to be Catholick. For as, of theſe two Propoſitions, There is a Church in <hi>America,</hi> and, There ſhould be a Church in <hi>America,</hi> The truth of the latter depends not upon the truth of the former, ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther does it in theſe two: There is a Church diffuſed all the world over, and, There ſhould be a Church diffuſed all the world over.</p>
                     <p n="44">44. Ad §. 17. The next Section in three long leaves delivers us this ſhort ſenſe. <hi>That thoſe Proteſtants which ſay they have not left the Churches external Communion, but only her corruptions pretend to do that which is impoſſible. Becauſe theſe corruptions were inherent in the Churches external Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion: and therefore he that forſakes them cannot but forſake this.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="45">45. <hi>Anſ.</hi> But who are they that pretend, they forſook the Churches corruptions, and not her external communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Some there be that ſay, they have not left the Church, that is, not ceaſed to be members of the Church, but only left her corruptions: ſome, that they have not left the communion, but the corruptions of it; meaning the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal communion of it, and conjunction with it by faith and obedience: which diſagree from the former only in the manner of ſpeaking: for he that is in the Church, is in this kind of communion with it: and he that is not in this internal communion, is not in the Church. Some perhaps, that they left not your external communion in all things; meaning, that they left it not voluntarily being not <hi>fugitivi</hi> but <hi>fugati,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Caſaubon in Ep. ad Card. Perron.</note> as being willing to joyn with you in any act of piety; but were by you neceſſitated &amp; conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to do ſo, becauſe you would not ſuffer them to do well with you, unleſs they would do ill with you. Now to do ill that you may do well, is againſt the will of God, which to every good man is a high degree of neceſſity. But for ſuch Proteſtants, as pretend that <hi>de facto, they forſook your cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions only and not your external communion,</hi> that is, ſuch as pretend to communicate with you in your Confeſſions and Liturgies, and participation of Sacraments, I cannot
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:57896:149"/>but doubt very much, that neither you nor I have ever met with any of this condition. And if perhaps you were led into error, by thinking that to leave the Church, and to leave the external communion of it, was all one in ſenſe and ſignification, I hope by this time you are diſabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and begin to underſtand, that as a man may leave a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny faſhion or cuſtom of a Colledge, and yet remain ſtill a member of the Colledge; ſo a man may poſſibly leave ſome opinion or practice of a Church formerly common to himſelf and others, and continue ſtill a member of that Church: Provided that what he forſakes be not one of thoſe things wherein the eſſence of the Church conſiſts. Whereas peradventure this practice may be ſo involved with the external communion of this Church, that it may be ſimply impoſſible, for him to leave this practice, and not to leave the Churches external communion.</p>
                     <p n="46">46. You will reply perhaps, <hi>That the difficulty lies as well againſt thoſe who pretend to forſake the Churches corruptions and not the Church: as againſt thoſe who ſay, they forſook the Churches corruptions, and not her external communion. And that the reaſon is ſtill the ſame: becauſe theſe ſuppoſed corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, were inherent in the whole Church, and therefore by like reaſon with the former, could not be forſaken, but if the whole Church were forſaken.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="47">47. <hi>Anſ.</hi> A pretty Sophiſm, and very fit to perſwade men that it is impoſſible for them, to forſake any Error they hold, or any Vice they are ſubject to, either peculiar to themſelves, or in common with others: Becauſe forſooth, they cannot forſake themſelves, and Vices and Errors are things inherent in themſelves. The deceit lies, in not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhing between a Local and a Moral forſaking of any thing. For as it were an abſurdity, fit for the maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Tranſubſtantiation to defend, that a man may locally and properly depart from the accidents of a ſubject, and not from the ſubject it ſelf: So is it alſo againſt reaſon to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, that a man may (by an uſual phraſe of ſpeech) for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake any cuſtom, or quality, good or bad, either proper to himſelf, or common to himſelf with any company, and yet never truly or properly forſake either his company or
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:57896:149"/>himſelf. Thus if all the Jeſuites in the Society, were given to write Sophiſtically, yet you might leave this ill cuſtome, and yet not leave your Society. If all the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens of a City, were addicted to any vanity, they might either, all, or ſome of them forſake it, and yet not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake the City. If all the parts of a mans Body were dirty or filthy, nothing hinders but that all or ſome of them might cleanſe themſelves, and yet continue parts of the Body. And what reaſon then in the World is there, if the whole viſible Church were overcome with Tares and Weeds of ſuperſtitions; and corruptions, but that ſome members of it might reform themſelves, and yet continue ſtill true members of the Body of the Church, and not be made no members, but the better by their Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?</p>
                     <p n="50">50. We acknowledge, that we cannot (as matters now ſtand) <hi>Separate from your corruptions, but we muſt depart from your External Communion.</hi> For you have ſo ordered things, that whoſoever will Communicate with you at all, muſt Communicate with you, in your corruptions. But it is you that will not perceive the difference, between, being a part of the Church, and being in external Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with all the other parts of it: taking for grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that which is certainly falſe, that no two men or Churches, divided in external Communion, can be both true parts of the Catholick Church.</p>
                     <p n="51">51. We are not <hi>to learn the difference between</hi> Schiſm <hi>and</hi> Hereſie, for <hi>Hereſie</hi> we conceive, an obſtinate defence of any Error, againſt any neceſſary Article of the Chriſtian Faith: And <hi>Schiſm,</hi> a cauſleſs ſeparation of one part of the Church from another. But this we ſay, That if we convince you of Errors and corruptions, profeſſed and practiſed in your Communion, then we cannot be Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks, for refuſing to joyn with you in the profeſſion of theſe Errors, and the practice of theſe corruptions. And therefore you muſt free your ſelves from Error, or us from <hi>Schiſm.</hi>

                     <p n="52">52. Laſtly, whereas you ſay, <hi>That you have demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted againſt us, that</hi> Proteſtants <hi>divided themſelves from the
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:57896:150"/>external Communion of the Viſible Church,</hi> add, <hi>which exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal communion was corrupted,</hi> and we ſhall confeſs the accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, and glory in it. But this is not that <hi>Quod erat de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrandum,</hi> but that we divided our ſelves from the Church, that is, made our ſelves Out-laws from it, and no members of it. And moreover, in the Reaſon of your ſeparation from the external Communion of your Church you are miſtaken: for it was not ſo much becauſe ſhe, your Church, as becauſe your Churches external Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion was corrupted, and needed Reformation.</p>
                     <p n="53">53. <hi>That a pretence of Reformation will acquit no man from Schiſm,</hi> we grant very willingly, and therefore ſay, that it concerns every man who ſeparates from any Churches Communion, even as much as his Salvation is worth, to look moſt carefully to it, that the cauſe of his ſeparation be juſt and neceſſary: For unleſs it be neceſſary, it can very hardly be ſufficient. But whether a true Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our ſelves from Errors, ſuperſtitions and impieties, will not juſtifie our ſeparation in theſe things; our ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I ſay, from them who will not reform themſelves, and as much as in them lies, hinder others from doing ſo: This is the point you ſhould have ſpoken to, but have not. As for the ſentences of the Fathers to which you refer us, for the determination of this Queſtion, I ſuppoſe by what I have ſaid above, the Reader underſtands, by alledging them you have gained little credit to your cauſe or perſon. And that, if they were competent Judges of this Controverſie, their ſentence is againſt you much ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than for you.</p>
                     <p n="56">56. But your Argument you conceive, will be more convincing, <hi>if we conſider that when</hi> Luther <hi>appeared, there were not two diſtinct Viſible true Churches, one Pure, the other Corrupted, but one Church only. Anſ.</hi> The ground of this is no way certain, nor here ſufficiently proved. For, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as you ſay, Hiſtories are ſilent of any ſuch matter: I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, there is no neceſſity, that you or I ſhould have read all Hiſtories, that may be extant of this matter; nor that all ſhould be extant that were written, much leſs extant uncorrupted: eſpecially conſidering your Church, which
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:57896:150"/>had latly all power in her hands, hath been ſo pernitiouſly induſtrious, in corrupting the monuments of Antiquity that made againſt her; nor that all Records ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main which were written; nor that all ſhould be record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed which was done.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, whereas you ſay, that ſuppoſing a viſible pure Church, <hi>Luther</hi> muſt be a Schiſmatick, who ſeparated from all viſible Churches: I tell you, if you will ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a Viſible Church extant before and when <hi>Luther</hi> aroſe, conformable to him in all points of Doctrine, neceſſary and profitable, then <hi>Luther</hi> ſeparated not from this Church, but adjoyned himſelf to it: Not indeed in place, which was not neceſſary, not in external Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion which was impoſſible, but by the Union of Faith and Charity. Upon theſe grounds I ſay, that the ground of this Argument is no way made certain, yet becauſe it is not manifeſtly falſe, I am content to let it paſs. And for ought I ſee, it is very ſafe for me to do ſo: for you build nothing upon it, which I may not fairly grant. For what do you conclude from hence, but that ſeeing there was no Viſible Church but corrupted, <hi>Luther</hi> forſaking the external Communion of the corrupted Church, could not but forſake the external Communion of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church? Well, let this alſo be granted, what will come of it? What, that <hi>Luther</hi> muſt be a Schiſmatick? By no means: For not every ſeparation, but only a cauſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſeparation from the Communion of the Church we maintain to be Schiſmatical. Hereunto may be added, that though the whole Church were corrupted, yet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſpeaking, it is not true, that <hi>Luther</hi> and his Followers forſook the whole corrupted Church, or the external Communion of it: But only that he forſook that Part of it which was corrupted, and ſtill would be ſo, and forſook not, but only reformed another Part, which Part they themſelves were, and I ſuppoſe you will not go about to perſuade us, that they forſook themſelves or their own Communion. And if you urge that they joyned them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to no other part, therefore they ſeparated from the whole: I ſay it follows not, in as much as themſelves were
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:57896:151"/>a part of it, and ſtill continued ſo: and therefore could no more ſeparate from the whole than from themſelves. Thus though there were no part of the People of <hi>Rome,</hi> to whom the <hi>Plebeians</hi> joyned themſelves, when they made their Seceſſion into the <hi>Aventine Hill,</hi> yet they divided themſelves from the <hi>Patricians</hi> only, and not from the whole People, becauſe themſelves were a part of this People, and they divided not from themſelves.</p>

Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth the cutting off ſuch men from the Church, lay any neceſſity upon us, either to go out of the World, or out of the Church, but rather puts theſe men out of the Church into the World, where we may converſe with them freely, without ſcandal to the Church, <hi>Our Bleſſed Saviour foretold,</hi> you ſay, <hi>that there ſhould be in the Church Tares with choice Corn.</hi> Look again I pray, and you ſhall ſee, that the field he ſpeaks of, is not the Church, but <hi>the World;</hi> and therefore neither doe You obey our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours command, <hi>Let both grow up till the Harveſt,</hi> who teach it to be lawful to root theſe Tears (ſuch are <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks</hi>) out of the World: neither do <hi>Proteſtants</hi> diſobey it, if they eject manifeſt Hereſies and notorious ſinners out of the Church.</p>

                     <p n="59">59. To your minor alſo, I anſwer almoſt in your own Words, §. 42. of this Chap. I thank you for your cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous ſuppoſal, that your Church may Err, and in recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence thereof, will do you a Charity, by putting you in mind, into what <hi>Labyrinths</hi> you caſt your ſelf, by ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing that the Church may Err in ſome of her Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals, and yet denying it lawful for any man though he know this, which you ſuppoſe, to oppoſe her judgment, or leave her communion. Will you have ſuch a man diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble againſt his Conſcience, or externally deny that which he knows true? No, that you will not, for them that do ſo, you your ſelf have pronounced <hi>A damned Crew of diſſembling Sycophants.</hi> Or would you have him continue in your Communion, and yet profeſs your Church to Err? This you your ſelves have made to him impoſſible. Or would you have him believe thoſe things true, which together with him you have ſuppoſed to be Errors? This in ſuch a one, as is aſſured or perſuaded of that, which you here ſuppoſe, that your Church doth Err, (and ſuch only we ſay, are obliged to forſake your Communion,) is, as Schoolmen ſpeak, <hi>Implicatio in termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis,</hi> a contradiction ſo plain, that one word deſtroyeth another; as if one ſhould ſay, a living dead man. For it is to require that they which believe ſome part of your Doctrine falſe, ſhould withal believe it all true. Seeing therefore, for any man to believe your Church in Error, and profeſs the contrary, is damnable Hypocriſie; to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:57896:152"/>it and not believe it, a manifeſt repugnancy; and thirdly, to profeſs it and to continue in your Communion (as matters now ſtand) a plain impoſſibility; what remains, but that whoſoever is ſuppoſed to have juſt reaſon to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believe any Doctrine of your Church, muſt of neceſſity forſake her Communion? Unleſs you would remit ſo far from your preſent rigour, as to allow them your Churches Communion, who publickly profeſs that they do not believe every Article of her eſtabliſhed Doctrine. Indeed, if you would do ſo, you might with ſome cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence ſuppoſe your Church in Error, and yet find fault with men for abandoning her Communion, becauſe they might continue in it, and ſuppoſe her in Error. But to ſuppoſe your Church in Error, and to excommunicate all thoſe that believe your own ſuppoſition, and then to complain that they continue not in your Communion, is the moſt ridiculous incongruity that can be imagined. And therefore though your corruptions in Doctrine, in themſelves (which yet is falſe) did not, yet your oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us, to profeſs your Doctrine uncorrupted againſt know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Conſcience, may induce an obligation to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from your Communion. As if there were any So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of Chriſtians, that held there were no Antipodes; notwithſtanding this Error I might communicate with them. But if I could not do ſo, without profeſſing my ſelf of their belief in this matter, then I ſuppoſe I ſhould be excuſed from Schiſm, if I ſhould forſake their Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, rather than profeſs my ſelf to believe that which I do not believe. Neither is there any contradiction, or ſhadow of contradiction, that it may be neceſſary for my Salvation to depart from this Churches Communion: And that this Church (though Erring in this matter) wants nothing neceſſary to Salvation.</p>

Anſw.</hi> The promiſe of Divine Aſſiſtance is twofold: Abſolute, or Conditional. That there ſhall be by Divine providence preſerved in the World to the Worlds end, ſuch a company of Chriſtians, who hold all things pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely and indiſpenſably neceſſary to Salvation, and nothing inevitably deſtructive of it: This and no more the Doctor affirms that God hath promiſed abſolutely. Yet he nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doubts nor denys, but that a farther aſſiſtance is conditionally promiſed us, even ſuch an aſſiſtance as ſhall lead us, if we be not wanting to it and our ſelves, into all not only neceſſary, but very profitable truth, and guard us from all not only deſtructive, but alſo hurtful Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors. This, I ſay, he neither denies nor queſtions. And ſhould he have done ſo, he might have been confuted by evident and expreſs Texts of Scripture. When therefore you ſay, That <hi>a Church not Erring in Fundamentals, doth as much as by Gods aſſiſtance lies in her power to do;</hi> This is manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly untrue. For Gods aſſiſtance is alwaies ready to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote her farther. It is ready, I ſay, but on condition the Church does implore it: on condition, that when it is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred in the Divine directions of Scripture and reaſon, the Church be not negligent to follow it. If therefore there be any Church, which retaining the foundation,
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:57896:153"/>builds <hi>Hay and Stubble</hi> upon it: which believing what is preciſely neceſſary, Errors ſhamefully and dangerouſly in other things very profitable: This by no means argues defect of Divine aſſiſtance in God, but neglect of this aſſiſtance in the Church. Neither is there any reaſon, why ſuch a Church ſhould pleaſe her ſelf too much, for retaining Fundamental truths, while ſhe remains ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardleſs of others. For though the ſimple defect of ſome truths profitable only and not ſimply neceſſary, may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt with Salvation; Yet who is there that can give her ſufficient aſſurance, that the neglect of ſuch truths is not damnable? Beſides, who is there that can put her in ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient caution, that theſe Errors about profitable matters may not according to the uſual fecundity of Error, bring forth others of a higher quality, ſuch as are pernitious and peſtilent, and undermine by ſecret conſequences the very foundations of Religion and Piety? Laſtly, who can ſay that ſhe hath ſufficiently diſcharged her duty to God and man by avoiding only Fundamental Hereſies, if in the mean time ſhe be negligent of others, which though they do not plainly deſtroy Salvation, yet obſcure and hinder, and only not block up the way to it? Which though of themſelves and immediately they damn no man, yet are cauſes and occaſions that many men run the race of Chriſtian Piety more remiſly than they ſhould, many defer their repentance, many go on ſecurely in their ſins, and ſo at length are damned by means and occaſion of theſe Errors, though not for them. Such Errors as theſe (though thoſe of the <hi>Roman Church</hi> be much worſe, even <hi>in themſelves damnable, and by accident only pardonable</hi>) yet I ſay ſuch Errors as theſe, if any Church ſhould tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, diſſemble and ſuffer them to reign, and neglect to reform them, and not permit them to be freely, yet peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably, oppoſed and impugned; will any wiſe man ſay, that ſhe hath ſufficiently diſcharged her duty to God and man? That ſhe hath with due fidelity diſpenſed the Goſpel of Chriſt? That ſhe hath done what ſhe could, and what ſhe ought? What ſhall we ſay then, if theſe Errors be taught by her, and commanded to be taught? What if ſhe thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:57896:153"/>out her curſes againſt thoſe that will not believe them? What if ſhe rave and rage againſt them, and perſecute them with Fire and Sword, and all kinds of moſt exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite torments? Truly I do much fear, that from ſuch a Church (though it hold no Error abſolutely unconſiſtent with Salvation,) the Candleſtick of God, either is alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy removed, or will be very ſhortly, and becauſe ſhe is negligent of profitable truths, that ſhe will loſe thoſe that are Neceſſary, and becauſe ſhe will not be led into all truths, that in ſhort time ſhe ſhall be led into none. And although this ſhould not happen, yet what mortal man can ſecure us, that not only a probable unaffected ignorance, nor only a meer neglect of profitable truths, but alſo a wretchleſs ſupine negligence, manifeſt contempt, Diſſimulation, Oppoſition, Oppreſſion of them, may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt with Salvation? I truly for my part, though I hope very well of all ſuch as ſeeking all truth, find that which is neceſſary; who endeavouring to free themſelves from all Errors, any way contrary to the purity of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, yet fail of performance and remain in ſome: yet if I did not find in my ſelf a love and deſire of all profitable truth; If I did not put away idleneſs, and prejudice, and worldly affections, and ſo examine to the bottom all my opinions of Divine matters, being prepared in mind to follow God, and God only which way ſoever he ſhall lead me; If I did not hope, that I either do, or endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to do theſe things, certainly I ſhould have little hope of obtaining Salvation.</p>
                     <p n="62">62. Obj. <hi>But to oblige any man under pain of damnation to forſake a Church by reaſon of ſuch Errors, againſt which Chriſt thought it ſuperfluous to promiſe his aſſiſtance, and for which he neither denies his grace here, nor his glory hereafter, what is it but to make the narrow way to Heaven, narrower than Chriſt left it? Anſw.</hi> It is not: for Chriſt himſelf hath obliged us hereunto: He hath forbidden us under pain of damnation to profeſs what we believe not, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently under the ſame penalty, to leave that Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in which we cannot remain without this hypocritical profeſſion of thoſe things, which we are convinced to be
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:57896:154"/>erroneous. But then beſides, it is here falſely ſuppoſed, (as hath been ſhewed already) that Chriſt hath not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed aſſiſtance to thoſe that ſeek it, but only in matters ſimply neceſſary. Neither is there any reaſon, why any Church, even in this World, ſhould deſpair of Victory over all Errors pernitious or noxious; provided ſhe hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly and earneſtly implore Divine aſſiſtance, depend whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon it, and be not wanting to it. Though a <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph over all ſin and Error,</hi> that is, ſecurity that ſhe nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth nor can Err, be rather to be deſired than hoped for on Earth, being a felicity reſerved for Heaven.</p>
                     <p n="63">63. Ad §. 21.] Obj. <hi>But at leaſt the</hi> Roman <hi>Church is as infallible as</hi> Proteſtants, <hi>and</hi> Proteſtants <hi>as fallible as the</hi> Roman <hi>Church: therefore to forſake the</hi> Roman <hi>Church for Errors, what is it but to flit from one Erring Society to another? Anſ.</hi> The inconſequence of this Argument is too apparent: <hi>Proteſtants</hi> may Err as well as the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> therefore they did ſo! Boys in the Schools know, that <hi>à Poſſe ad Eſſe,</hi> the Argument follows not. He is equally fallible that believes twiſe two to be four, as he that believes them to be twenty: yet in this, he is not equally deceived, and he may be certain that he is not ſo. One Architect is no more infallible than another, and yet he is more ſecure that his work is right and ſtreight who hath made it by the level, than he which hath made it by gueſs and by chance. So he that forſakes the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and therefore renounceth her Communion, that he may renounce the profeſſion of her Errors, though he knows himſelf fallible, as well as thoſe whom he hath forſaken, yet he may be certain (as certain as the nature of the thing will bear) that he is not herein deceived: becauſe he may ſee the Doctrine forſaken by him repugnant to Scripture, and the Doctrine embraced by him conſonant to it. At leaſt, this he may know, that the Doctrine which he hath choſen to him ſeems true, and the contrary which he hath forſaken, ſeems falſe: And therefore without remorſe of Conſcience, he may profeſs that, but this he cannot.</p>

                     <p n="64">64. <hi>Obj.</hi> But <hi>we are to remember, that according to Doctor</hi> Potter <hi>the Viſible Church hath a bleſſing not to Err in Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals, in which any private Reformer may fail, therefore there was no neceſſity of forſaking the Church, out of whoſe Communion they were expoſed to danger of falling into many more, and even into damnable Errors. Anſw.</hi> The Viſible Church is free indeed from all Errors abſolutely deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive and unpardonable, but not from all Error which in it ſelf is damnable: not from all which will actually bring damnation upon them, that keep themſelves in them, by their own voluntary and avoidable fault.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, any private man who truly believes the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, and ſeriouſly endeavours to know the will of God, and to do it, is as ſecure as the Viſible Church, more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure than your Church from the danger of Erring in Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals: for it is impoſſible, that any man ſo quallified ſhould fall into any Error which to him will prove dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable. For God requires no more of any man to his Salvation, but his true endeavour to be ſaved. Laſtly, abiding in your Churches Communion is ſo far from ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing me or any man from damnable Error, that if I ſhould abide in it, I am certain I could not be ſaved. For abide in it I cannot, without profeſſing to believe your en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire Doctrine true: profeſs this I cannot, but I muſt lie per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually, and exulcerate my Conſcience. And though your Errors were not in themſelves damnable, yet to reſiſt the known Truth, and to continue in the profeſſion of known Errors were not in themſelves damnable, yet to reſiſt the known Truth, and to continue in the profeſſion of known Errors and falſhoods, is certainly a capital ſin, and of great affinity with the ſin which ſhall never be forgiven.</p>
                     <p n="65">65. Obj. <hi>But neither is the</hi> Proteſtant <hi>Church free from corruptions ond Errors: And what man of Judgment will be a</hi> Proteſtant, <hi>ſince that Church is confeſſedly a corrupted one?</hi>

And why I pray, may not a man of judgment continue in the Communion of a Church confeſſedly cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, as well as in a Church ſuppoſed to be corrupted? Eſpecially when this Church ſuppoſed to be corrupted, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:57896:155"/>the belief and profeſſion of her ſuppoſed corruptions, as the condition of her Communion: which this Church confeſſedly corrupted, doth not.

To prefer indifferrent good health, before a diſeaſed and corrupted ſtate of Body? To pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer a field not perfectly weeded, before a field that is quite over-run with Weeds and Thorns? and therefore though <hi>Proteſtants</hi> have ſome Errors, yet ſeeing they are neither ſo great as yours, nor impoſed with ſuch Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, nor maintained with ſuch obſtinacy; he that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives it any diſparagement to his judgment, to change your Communion for theirs, though confeſſed to have ſome corruptions, it may well be preſumed that he hath but little judgment.</p>

But then we ſay not, that the Communion of any Church is to be forſaken for Errors unfundamental, unleſs it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act with all either a diſſimulation of them being noxious; or a Profeſſion of them againſt the dictate of Conſcience, if they be meer Errors. This if the Church does (as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly yours doth,) then her Communion is to be forſak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, rather than the ſin of Hypocriſie to be committed. Whereas to forſake the Churches of <hi>Proteſtants</hi> for ſuch Errors, there is no neceſſity, becauſe they Err to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and do not under pain of Excommunication ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act the profeſſion of their Errors.</p>
                     <p n="68">68. Obj. <hi>But the Church may not be left by reaſon of ſin, therefore neither by reaſon of Errors not Fundamental: in as

Anſw.</hi> The reaſon of the conſequence does not appear to me: But I anſwer to the Antecedent: Neither for ſin or Errors, ought a Church to be forſaken, if ſhe does not impoſe and joyn them: but if ſhe do, (as the <hi>Roman</hi> does,) then we muſt forſake men rather than God; leave the Churches Communion rather than commit ſin, or profeſs known Errors, to be Divine truths. For the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> hath aſſured us, that to ſay, <hi>the Lord hath ſaid ſo, when the Lord hath not ſaid ſo,</hi> is a great ſin and a high preſumption, be the matter never ſo ſmall.</p>
                     <p n="69">69. Ad §. 23.] Obj. <hi>But neither the Quality nor the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of your Churches Errors, could warrant our forſaking of it.

Anſw.</hi> Here again you vainly ſuppoſe, that we conceive your Errors in themſelves not damnable: Though we hope they are not abſolutely unpardonable: but to ſay they are pardonable, is indeed to ſuppoſe them damnable. Secondly, though the Errors of your Church did not warrant our departure, yet your Tyrannous im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of them, would be our ſufficient juſtification. For this lays neceſſity on us, either to forſake your company, or to profeſs what we know to be falſe.</p>

Obj. <hi>Our Bleſſed Saviour hath declared his Will, that we forgive a private offender Seventy Seven times, that is, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out limitation of quantity of time, or quality of Treſpaſſes; and then how dare we alledge his command, that we muſt not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don his Church for Errors acknowledged to be not Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal? Anſw.</hi> He that commands us to pardon our Brother ſinning againſt us ſo often, will not allow us for his ſake to ſin with him, ſo much as once. He will have us do any thing but ſin, rather than offend any man. But his will is alſo, that we offend all the World, rather than ſin in the leaſt matter. And therefore though his will were, and it were in our power (which yet is falſe) to pardon the Errors of an Erring Church; yet certainly it is not his will, that we ſhould Err with the Church, or if we do
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:57896:156"/>not, that we ſhould againſt Conſcience profeſs the Errors of it.</p>
                     <p n="71">71. Ad §. 24.] Obj. <hi>But Schiſmaticks from the Church of</hi> England <hi>or any other Church, with this very Anſwer, that they forſake not the Church but the Errors of it, may caſt off from themſelves the imputation of Schiſm.</hi> Anſw. True, they may make the ſame Anſwer, and the ſame defence as we do, as a Murtherer can cry not guilty, as well as an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent perſon, but not ſo truly nor ſo juſtly. The que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is, not what may be pretended, but what can be proved by Schiſmaticks. They may object Errors to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Churches, as well as we do to yours, but that they prove their accuſation ſo ſtrongly as we can, that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears not. To the Prieſts and Elders of the <hi>Jews,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing that ſacred ſilence mentioned in the <hi>Acts</hi> of the Apoſtles, S. <hi>Peter</hi> and S. <hi>John</hi> anſwered <hi>they muſt obey God rather than men.</hi> The three Children to the King of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi> gave in effect the ſame anſwer. Give me now any factious Hypocrite, who makes Religion the pretence and Cloke of his Rebellion, and who ſees not that ſuch a one may anſwer for himſelf, in thoſe very formal words, which the Holy Apoſtles and Martyrs made uſe of. And yet I preſume no Chriſtian will deny, but this anſwer was good, in the mouth of the Apoſtles and Martyrs, though it were obnoxious to be uſed, by Traitors and Rebels. Certainly therefore, it is no good conſequence to ſay, Schiſmaticks may make uſe of this Anſwer, therefore all that do make uſe of it are Schiſmaticks. But moreover, it is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that the cheif part of our defence, that you deny your Communion to all that deny or doubt of any part of your Doctrine, cannot with any colour be imployed againſt <hi>Proteſtants:</hi> who grant their Communion to all who hold with them, not all things, but things neceſſary, that is, ſuch as are in Scripture plainly delivered.</p>
                     <p n="72">72. Obj. <hi>But the forſaking the</hi> Roman <hi>Church opens a way to innumerable Sects and Schiſms, and therefore it muſt not be forſaken.

<pb n="304" facs="tcp:57896:157"/>themſelves to the chief Mufty of the <hi>Turks,</hi> it is apparent, there would be no diviſions; yet Unity is not to be purchaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at ſo dear a rate. It were a thing much to be deſired, that there were no diviſions: yet difference of opinions touching points controverted, is rather to be choſen, than unanimous concord in damned Errors: As it is better for men to go to Heaven by diverſe ways, or rather by divers Paths of the ſame way, than in the ſame path to go on peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably to Hell. <hi>Amica Pax, magis amica Veritas!</hi> Peace is dear to me, but Truth is dearer.</p>
                     <p n="74">74. Ad §. 26.27.] Here you make D. <hi>Potter</hi> to ſay, <hi>that Proteſtants did well to forſake the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they judged ſhe retained all means neceſſary to Salvation. Anſw.</hi> Who was ever ſo ſtupid as to give this ridiculous reaſon? D. <hi>Potter</hi> Vindicates <hi>Proteſtants</hi> for Schiſm two ways: The one is, becauſe they had juſt and great and neceſſary cauſe to ſeparate, which Schiſmaticks never have; becauſe they that have it are no Schiſmaticks: For Schiſm is always a cauſeleſs ſeparation. The other is, becauſe they did not joyn with their ſeparation, an uncharitable damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all thoſe from whom they did divide themſelves, as the manner of Schiſmaticks is. Now that which he intends for a circumſtance of our ſeparation, you make him make the cauſe of it, and the motive to it. And whereas he ſays, <hi>though we ſeparate from you in ſome things, yet we acknowledge your Church a member of the Body of Chriſt, and therefore are not Schiſmaticks:</hi> You make him ſay moſt abſurdly, <hi>we did well to forſake you, becauſe we judged you a member of the Body of Chriſt.</hi> Juſt as if a Brother ſhould leave his Brothers com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany in ſome ill courſes, and ſhould ſay to him, Herein I forſake you, yet I leave you not abſolutely, for I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge you ſtill to be my Brother, and ſhall uſe you as a Brother: And you perverting his ſpeech, ſhould pretend that he had ſaid, I leave your company in theſe ill courſes, and I do well to do ſo, becauſe you are my Brother: ſo making that the cauſe of his leaving him, which indeed is the cauſe that he left him no farther.</p>
                     <p n="75">75. Obj. But you ſay, <hi>The very reaſon for which he acquitteth himſelf for Schiſm, is becauſe he holds that the

If a man denying obedience in ſome unlawful mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to his lawful Sovereign, ſhould ſay to him, herein I diſobey you, but yet I am no Rebel, becauſe I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge you my Sovereign Lord, and am ready to obey you in all things lawful, ſhould not he be an egregious Syco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant, that ſhould accuſe him as if he had ſaid, I do well to diſobey you, becauſe I acknowledge you my lawful Soveraign? Certainly he that joyns this acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment with his neceſſitated diſobedience, does well; but he that makes this conſideration the reaſon of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience, doth ill.</p>
                     <p n="76">76. Obj. <hi>It is an unſpeakable comfort to Catholicks</hi> (you ſay) <hi>that we cannot clear our ſelves from Schiſm otherwiſe, than by acknowledging that</hi> we do <hi>not, nor cannot cut off your Church from the hope of ſalvation.</hi>

                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> I beſeech you to take care that this falſe comfort coſt you not too dear. For why this good opinion of God Almighty, that he will not damn men for error, who were without their own fault ignorant of the truth, ſhould be any conſolation to them, who having the key of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, will neither uſe it themſelves, nor permit others to uſe it; who have eyes to ſee and will not ſee, who have ears to hear and will not hear! this I aſſure you paſſeth my capacity to apprehend.

                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> It ſeems then in your judgment, that Thieves and Adulterers, and Murtherers, and Traytors may ſay with as much probability as Proteſtants, that they did no hurt to others, but only reform themſelves. But then methinks it is very ſtrange, that all Proteſtants ſhould agree with one conſent in this defence of themſelves from the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Schiſm: and that to this day, never any Thief or Murtherer ſhould have been heard of to make uſe of this Apology! And then for Schiſmaticks I would know, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Victor</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> who excommunicated the Churches of <hi>Aſia</hi> for not conforming to his Church in keeping <hi>Eaſter;</hi> whether <hi>Novatian</hi> that divided from <hi>Cornelius,</hi> upon pretence that himſelf was elected Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> when indeed he was not; whether <hi>Feliciſſimus</hi> and his Crew, that went out of the Church of <hi>Carthage,</hi> and ſet up altar againſt altar, becauſe having fallen in perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, they might not be reſtored to the peace of the Church preſently, upon the interceſſion of the Confeſſors; whether the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> who divided from, and damned all the world, becauſe all the world would not excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate them who were accuſed only and not convicted to have been Traditors of the ſacred Books; whether they which for the ſlips and infirmity of others, which they might and ought to tolerate, or upon ſome difference in matters of Order and Ceremony, or for ſome error in Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin, neither pernitious nor hurtful to faith or piety, ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate themſelves from others, or others from themſelves; or laſtly, whether they that put themſelves out of the Churches unity and obedience, becauſe their opinions are not appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved there, but reprehended and confuted, or becauſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of impious converſation, they are impatient of their Churches cenſure: I would know I ſay, whether all, or any of theſe, may with any face or without extream im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudency, put in this plea of Proteſtants, and pretend with as much likelihood as they, that they did not ſeparate from others, but only reform themſelves? But ſuppoſe they were ſo impudent as to ſay ſo in their own defence falſely, doth it follow by any good Logick, that therefore this A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pology is not to be imployed by Proteſtants, who may ſay
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:57896:158"/>ſo truly? <hi>We make</hi> (ſay they) <hi>no Schiſm from you, but only a reformation of our ſelves: This,</hi> you reply, <hi>is no good juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, becauſe it may be pretended by any Schiſmatick.</hi> Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry true, any Schiſmatick that can ſpeak may ſay the ſame words, (as any Rebel that makes conſcience the cloak of his impious diſobedience, may ſay with S. <hi>Peter</hi> and S. <hi>John, we muſt obey God rather than men;</hi>) But then the queſtion is, whether any Schiſmatick may ſay ſo truly? And to this queſtion you ſay juſt nothing: but conclude, becauſe this defence may be abuſed by ſome, it muſt be uſed by none. As if you ſhould have ſaid, S. <hi>Peter</hi> and S. <hi>John</hi> did ill to make ſuch an anſwer as they made, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe impious Hypocrites might make uſe of the ſame to palliate their diſobedience and rebellion againſt the lawful commands of lawful Authority.</p>
                     <p n="81">81. Obj. <hi>But ſeeing their pretended Reformation conſiſted in forſaking the Churches corruptions, their Reformation of themſelves, and their diviſion from you, falls out to be one and the ſame thing.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> Juſt as if two men having been a long while com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions in drunkenneſs, one of them ſhould turn ſober; this Reformation of himſelf, and diſertion of his compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in this ill cuſtom, would be one and the ſame thing, and yet there is no neceſſity that he ſhould leave his love to him at all, or his ſociety in other things. So Proteſtants forſaking their own former corruptions, which were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to them with you, could not chooſe but withal forſake you in the practice of theſe corruptions: yet this they might, and would have done without breach of Charity towards you; and without a renunciation of your compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in any act of piety and devotion, confeſſedly lawful. And therefore though both theſe were by accident joyned together, yet this hinders not but that the end they aimed at, was not a ſeparation from you, but a reformation of themſelves.</p>
                     <p n="82">82. Neither <hi>doth their diſagreement in the particulars of the Reformation,</hi> (which yet when you meaſure it without partiality, you'll find to be far ſhort of infinite) <hi>nor their ſymbolizing in the general of forſaking your corruptions,</hi> prove
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:57896:159"/>any thing to the contrary, or any way advantage your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign or make for your purpoſe. For it is not any ſign at all, much leſs an evident ſign, that they had no ſetled de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, but only to forſake the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but malice can deny, that their intent at leaſt was, to reduce Religion to that original purity from which it was fallen. The declination from which, ſome concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to have begun (though ſecretly) in the Apoſtles times, <hi>(the myſtery of iniquity being then in work;)</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their departure to have ſhewed it ſelf more openly: o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers again believing, that the Church continued pure for ſome Ages after the Apoſtles, and then declined: And conſequently ſome aiming at an exact conformity with the Apoſtolick times: Others thinking they ſhould do God and men good ſervice, could they reduce the Church to the condition of the fourth and fifth ages: Some taking their direction in this work of Reformation, only from Scripture; others from the Writings of Fathers, and the Decrees of Councils of the firſt five Ages: certainly it is no great marvel, that there was, as you ſay, diſagreement between them, in the particulars of their Reformation; nay morally ſpeaking, it was impoſſible it ſhould be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. Yet let me tell you, the difference between them (eſpecially in compariſon of your Church and Religion,) is not the difference between good and bad, but between good and better: And they did beſt that followed Scripture, interpreted by Catholick written Tradition: which rule the Reformers of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> propoſed to themſelves to follow.</p>
                     <p n="83">83. Ad 30.31, 32.] D. <hi>Potter,</hi> p. 81.82. of his Book, ſpeak thus. <hi>If a Monaſtery ſhould reform it ſelf, and ſhould reduce into practice ancient good diſcipline, when others would not: In this caſe could it be charged with Schiſm from others, or with Apoſtacy from its rule and order? So in a ſociety of men univerſally infected with ſome diſeaſe, they that ſhould free themſelves from it, could they be therefore ſaid to ſeparate from the ſociety?</hi> He preſumes they could not, and from hence concludes, <hi>That neither can the Reformed Churches be truly accuſed for making a Schiſm, (that is ſeparating
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:57896:159"/>from the Church, and making themſelves no members of it) if all they did was (as indeed it was) to reform them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</hi>

                     <p n="84">84. Now inſtead of theſe two inſtances, which plainly ſhewed it poſſible in other ſocieties, and conſequently in that of the Church, to leave the faults of a Society, and not leave being of it, you diſingenuouſly foiſt in two other inſtances, clean croſs to the Doctors purpoſe, of men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der colour of faults, abandoning the Society wherein they lived.</p>

And that ſome inferiour Monks more conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entious than the reſt, diſcovering this abuſe, ſhould firſt with all earneſtneſs ſollicite their Superiors for a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral and orderly reformation of theſe, though ſmall and venial corruptions, yet corruptions: But finding they ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped and laboured in vain to effect this, ſhould reform theſe faults in themſelves, and refuſe to joyn in the practice of them, with the reſt of their Confraternity, and perſiſting reſolutely in ſuch a refuſal, ſhould by their Superiors be caſt out of their Monaſtery, and being not to be re-admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted without a promiſe of remitting from their ſtiffneſs in theſe things, and of condeſcending to others in the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of their ſmall faults, ſhould chooſe rather to continue exiles, than to re-enter upon ſuch conditions: I would know whether you would condemn ſuch men of Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy from the Order? Without doubt if you ſhould, you would find the ſtream of your Caſuiſts againſt you, and beſides, involve S. <hi>Paul</hi> in the ſame condemnation, who plainly tells, that <hi>we may not do the leaſt evil, that we may do the greateſt good.</hi> Put caſe again, you ſhould be part of a Society univerſally infected with ſome diſeaſe, and diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering

And therefore what can follow from it, but perhaps in the judgment of carnal policy, the temporal benefit and tranquillity of temporal States and kingdoms, but the infinit pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, if not the deſolation of the kingdom of Chriſt? And therefore it well becomes them who have their por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in this life, who ſerve no higher State than that of <hi>England,</hi> or <hi>Spain,</hi> or <hi>France,</hi> nor this neither any further than they may ſerve themſelves by it; who think of no other happineſs but the preſervation of their own fortunes and tranquillity in this World; who think of no other means to preſerve States, but humane power and Machi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avillian policy; and believe no other Creed but this, <hi>Regi aut Civitati imperium habenti nihil injuſtum, quod utile!</hi> that to a King or City that has Ruling Power, nothing that is profitable is unjuſt.

For if all be vain and falſe, (as in their judgment it is) the preſent whatſoever, is better than any, becauſe it is already ſetled: and alteration of it may draw with it change of States, and the change of State the ſubverſion of their fortune. But they that are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed Servants and lovers of Chriſt, of Truth, of the Church, and of Man-kind, ought with all courage to oppoſe themſelves againſt it, as a common Enemy of all theſe. They that know there is a King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, by whoſe will and pleaſure Kings and Kingdoms ſtand and fall, they know, that to no King or State any thing can be profitable which is unjuſt; and that nothing can be more evidently unjuſt, than to force weak men by the profeſſion of a Religion which they believe not,

Therefore if <hi>Proteſtants</hi> did offer vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence to other Mens Conſciences and compel them to embrace their Reformation, I excuſe them not: much leſs if they did ſo to the ſacred Perſons of Kings, and thoſe that were in authority over them, who ought to be ſo ſecured from violence, that even thier unjuſt and Tyrannous violence, though it may be avoided (according to that of our Saviour, <hi>When they perſecute you in one Citty fly into another,</hi>) yet may it not be reſiſted by oppoſing vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence againſt it. <hi>Proteſtants</hi> therefore that were guilty of this crime, are not to be excuſed, and bleſſed had they been, had they choſen rather to be Martyrs than Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers, and to die for their Religion rather than to fight for it. But of all the men in the World you are the moſt unfit to accuſe them hereof, againſt whom the Souls of Martyrs from under the Altar cry much louder than againſt all their other Perſecutors together: Who for theſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Ages together have daily ſacrificed <hi>Hecatombs</hi> of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent Chriſtians, under the name of Hereticks, to your blind zeal and furious ſuperſtition.

But for their departing corporally from them, whom mentally they had forſaken: For their forſaking the external Communion and company of that part of the unreformed part of the Church, in their ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitions and impieties: thus much of your accuſation we embrace and glory in it; And ſay though ſome Proteſtants might offend in the manner or the degree of their ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet certainly their ſeparation it ſelf was not Schiſmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, but Innocent, and not only ſo, but juſt and neceſſary.</p>

For by <hi>Firſt,</hi> all men underſtand either that which is before all, or that before which is nothing.

Ad §. 39.] In the next place you number up your Victories, and tell us, <hi>that out of theſe premiſes, this conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion follows, That</hi> Luther <hi>and his followers were Schiſmaticks from the Viſible Church, the</hi> Pope, <hi>the Dioceſs wherein they were baptized, from the Biſhop under whom they lived, from the Country to which they belonged, from their Religious order, wherein they were profeſſed, from one another, and laſtly, from a mans ſelf: Becauſe the ſelf ſame</hi> Proteſtant <hi>is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed to day, that his yeſterdays opinion was an Error.</hi> To which I anſwer, that <hi>Luther</hi> and his followers ſeparated from many of theſe, in ſome opinions and practices: But that they did it without cauſe, which only can make them Schiſmaticks, that was the only thing you ſhould have proved, and to that you have not urged one rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of any moment. All of them for weight and ſtrength, were couſin-germans to this pretty device, wherewith you will prove them Schiſmaticks from themſelves, <hi>becauſe the ſelf ſame</hi> Proteſtant <hi>to day is convicted in Conſcience, that his yeſterdays opinion was an Error.</hi> It ſeems then that they that hold Errors, muſt hold them faſt, and take eſpecial care of being convicted in Conſcience, that they are in Error, for fear of being Schiſmaticks! <hi>Proteſtants</hi> muſt continue <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> and <hi>Puritans Puritans,</hi> and <hi>Papiſts Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts,</hi> nay <hi>Jews,</hi> and <hi>Turks,</hi> and <hi>Pagans,</hi> muſt remain <hi>Jews,</hi> and <hi>Turks,</hi> and <hi>Pagans,</hi> and go on conſtantly to the Devil, or elſe forſooth they muſt be <hi>Schiſmaticks,</hi> and that <hi>from themſelves.</hi> And this perhaps is the cauſe that makes <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts</hi> ſo obſtinate, not only in their common ſuperſtition, but alſo in adhering to the proper fancies of their ſeveral Sects, ſo that it is a miracle to hear of any Jeſuit, that hath forſaken the opinion of the Jeſuits: or any <hi>Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi> that hath changed his or the Jeſuits.</p>
                     <p>But ſure the forſaking of error cannot be a ſin, unleſs to be in error be a vertue. And therefore, to do as you
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:57896:165"/>do, to damn men for falſe opinions, and to call them Schiſmaticks for leaving them; to make pertinacy in er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, that is, an unwillingneſs to be convicted, or a reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion not to be convicted, the form of Hereſies, and to find fault with men, for being convicted in conſcience that they are in error, is the moſt incoherent and contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious injuſtice that ever was heard of. But Sir, if this be a ſtrange matter to you, that which I ſhall tell you will be much ſtranger. I know a man that of a moderate Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant turned a Papiſt, and the day that he did ſo, (as all things that are done are perfected ſome day or other,) was convicted in conſcience, that his yeſterdays opinion was an error, and yet thinks he was no Schiſmatick for doing ſo, and deſires to be informed by you, whether or no he was miſtaken? The ſame man afterwards upon better conſideration, became a doubting Papiſt, and of a doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Papiſt, a confirmed Proteſtant. And yet this man thinks himſelf no more to blame for all theſe changes, than a Traveller, who uſing all diligence to find the right way to ſome remote City, where he never had been, (as the party I ſpeak of had never been in Heaven,) did yet mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake it, and after find his error, and amend it. Nay he ſtands upon his juſtification ſo far, as to maintain that his alterations, not only to you, but alſo from you by Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, were the moſt ſatisfactory actions to himſelf, that ever he did, and the greateſt victories that ever he obtained over himſelf, and his affections to thoſe things which in this world are moſt precious; as wherein for Gods ſake and (as he was verily perſwaded,) out of love to the Truth, he went upon a certain expectation of thoſe inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which to ingenuous natures are of all moſt terrible. So that though there were much weakneſs in ſome of theſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations, yet certainly there was no wickedneſs. Neither does he yield his weakneſs altogether without apology, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his deductions were rational, and out of Principles commonly received by Proteſtants as well as Papiſts, and which by his education had got poſſeſſion of his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.</p>

And therefore though Seditious men in Church and State, may pretend conſcience for a cloak of their rebellion: yet this I hope hinders not, but that an honeſt man ought to obey his rightly informed conſcience, rather than the unjuſt commands of his Tyrannous Superiors. Otherwiſe with what colour can you defend either your own refuſing the Oaths of Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and Supremacy?

To as little purpoſe is your rule out of <hi>Lyrinenſis</hi> againſt them that followed <hi>Luther,</hi> ſeeing they pretend and are ready to juſtifie, that they forſook not, with the Doctors, the faith, but only the corruption of the Church. As vain altogether is that which follows: That <hi>in caſes of uncertainty we are not to leave our Superior, or caſt off his obedience, nor publickly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe his decrees.</hi> From whence it will follow very evidently, that ſeeing it is not a matter of faith, but a diſputed que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion among you, whether the Oath of Allegiance be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful: that either you acknowledge not the King your Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior, or do againſt conſcience, in oppoſing his and the kingdoms decree, requiring the taking of this Oath.

The <hi>quaere</hi> is, whether he ought for matter of practice follow the injunction of authority, or his own private and only probable perſwaſion? M. <hi>Hooker</hi> reſolves for the former, upon this ground, that the <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain commands of the Church we live in, are to be obeyed in all things, not certainly unlawful.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As for requiring a blind and an unlimited obedience, to Eccleſiaſtical deciſions univerſally and in all caſes, even when plain Text or reaſon ſeems to controul them, M. <hi>Hooker</hi> is as far from making ſuch an Idol of Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Authority, as the Puritans whom he writes againſt. <hi>I grant</hi> (ſaith he,) <hi>that proof derived from the authority of
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:57896:167"/>mans judgment, is not able to work that aſſurance which doth grow by a ſtronger proof. And therefore although ten thouſand General Councils would ſet down one and the ſame definitive ſentence, concerning any point of Religion whatſoever, yet one demonſtrative reaſon alledged, or one manifeſt teſtimony cited from the word of God himſelf, to the contrary, could not chooſe but over-weigh them all: in as much as for them to be deceived it is not impoſſible, it is that Demonſtrative Reaſon, or Divine Teſtimony ſhould deceive.</hi> And again, <hi>Whereas it is thought, that eſpecially with the Church, and thoſe that are called, mans authority ought not to prevail: It muſt and doth prevail even with them, yea with them eſpecially, as far as equity requireth, and farther we maintain it not. For men to be tied and led by authority, as it were with a kind of captivity of judgment, and though there be reaſon to the contrary, not to liſten to it, but to follow like beaſts, the firſt in the Herd, this were brutiſh.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, <hi>that authority of men ſhould prevail with men either a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt or above reaſon, is no part of our belief. Companies of learned men, be they never ſo great and reverend, are to yield unto reaſon, the weight whereof, is no whit prejudiced by the ſimplicity of his perſon which doth alledge it, but being found to be ſound and good, the bare opinion of men to the contrary, muſt of neceſſity ſtoop and give place.</hi> Thus M. <hi>Hooker</hi> in his Seventh Section of his Second Book.</p>

                     <p>Ad §. 1. HE that will accuſe any one man, much more any great multitude of men of any great and horrible crime, ſhould in all reaſon and juſtice take care that the greatneſs of his evidence do equal, if not exceed the quality of the crime. And ſuch an accuſation you would here make ſhew of, by pretending, firſt, <hi>to lay ſuch grounds of it, as are either already proved, or elſe yielded on all ſides:</hi> and after to raiſe a firm and ſtable ſtructure of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing arguments upon them. But both theſe I find to be meer and vain pretences, and having conſidered this Chapter alſo without prejudice or paſſion, as I did the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, I am enforced by the light of Truth, to pronounce your whole diſcourſe, a painted and ruinous Building upon a weak and ſandy foundation.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Ad §. 2, 3. Firſt for your grounds, a great part of them, is falſely ſaid to be either proved or granted. It is true indeed that <hi>Man by his natural wit and induſtry could never have attained to the knowledge of Gods will to give him a ſupernatural and eternal happineſs,</hi> nor of the means by which his pleaſure was to beſtow this happineſs upon him.

                     <p n="3">3. But then whereas you add, <hi>that if a ſuch a knowledge were no more than probable, it could not be able ſufficiently to overbear our will, and encounter with human probabilities, being backed with the ſtrength of fleſh and blood, and therefore conclude, that it was farther neceſſary, that this ſupernatural knowledge ſhould be moſt certain and infallible:</hi> To this I anſwer, that I do heartily acknowledge and believe the Articles of our Faith be in themſelves Truths; as certain and infallible as the very common Principles of Geome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and Metaphyſicks. But that there is required of us a knowledge of them, and an adherence to them, as certain as that of ſenſe or ſcience, that ſuch a certainty is required of us under pain of damnation, ſo that no man can hope to be in the ſtate of ſalvation, but he that finds in himſelf ſuch a degree of faith, ſuch a ſtrength of adherence: This I have already demonſtrated to be a great error, and of dangerous and pernitious conſequence. And becauſe I am more and more confirmed in my perſwaſion that the Truth which I there delivered, is of great and ſingular uſe, I will here confirm it with more reaſons. And to ſatisfie you that this is no ſingularity of my own my Margent pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents you with a
<note n="a" place="margin">M. <hi>Hooker</hi> in his anſwer to <hi>Travers</hi> his ſupplication. — I have taught that the aſſurance of things which we believe by the word, is not ſo certain as of that we perceive by ſence. And is it as certain? Yea I taught, that the things which God doth promiſe in his word are ſurer unto us than any thing we touch, handle or ſee. But are we ſo ſure and certain of them? If we be, why doth God ſo often prove his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes unto us, as he doth by arguments taken from our ſenſible experience? We muſt be ſurer of the proof than the thing proved, otherwiſe it is no proof. How is it that if ten men do all look upon the Moon, every one of them knows it as certainly to be the Moon as another: but many believing one and the ſame promiſes all have not one and the ſame fulneſs of perſwaſion? How falleth it out that men being aſſured of any thing by ſence, can be no ſurer of it than they are? whereas the ſtrongeſt in faith that liveth upon the earth, had always need to labour, and ſtrive, and pray, that his aſſurance con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning heavenly and ſpiritual things may grow, increaſe, and be augmented.</note> Proteſtant Divine of great authority, and no way ſingular in his opinions, who hath long ſince preached and juſtified the ſame doctrin.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. I ſay that every Text of Scripture which makes men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any that were <hi>weak,</hi> or of any that were <hi>ſtrong in faith:</hi> of any that were <hi>of little,</hi> or any that were <hi>of great faith:</hi>
                        <pb n="328" facs="tcp:57896:169"/>of any that <hi>abounded,</hi> or any that were <hi>rich</hi> in ſaith: of <hi>encreaſing, growing, rooting, grounding, eſtabliſhing, confirming in faith:</hi> Every ſuch Text, is a demonſtrative refutation of this vain fancy: proving that faith, even true and ſaving faith, is not a thing conſiſting in ſuch an indiviſible point of perfection as you make it, but capable of augmentation and diminution. Every Prayer you make to God to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe your faith (or if you conceive ſuch a prayer dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory from the perfection of your faith, (<hi>The Apoſtles pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Chriſt to encreaſe their Faith,</hi> is a convincing argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ſame concluſion. Moreover if this doctrin of yours were true, then ſeeing not any the leaſt doubting can conſiſt with a moſt infallible certainty, it will follow that every leaſt doubting in any matter of faith, though reſiſted and involuntary, is a damnable ſin, abſolutely deſtructive, ſo long as it laſts, of all true and ſaving faith: which you are ſo far from granting, that you make it no ſin at all, but only an occaſion of merit: and if you ſhould eſteem it a ſin, then muſt you acknowledge, contrary to your own Principles, that there are Actual ſins meerly involuntary. The ſame is furthermore invincibly confirmed by every deliberate ſin that any Chriſtian commits; by any progreſs in Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity that he makes. For ſeeing, as S. <hi>John</hi> aſſures us, <hi>our faith is the victory which overcomes the world,</hi> certainly if the faith of all true Believers were perfect, (and if true faith be capable of no imperfection, if all faith be a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge moſt certain and infallible, all faith muſt be perfect, for the moſt imperfect that is, according to your doctrin, if it be true, muſt be <hi>moſt certain,</hi> and ſure the moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect that is, cannot be more than moſt certain,) then cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly their victory over the World, and therefore over the fleſh, and therefore over ſin, muſt of neceſſity be perfect, and ſo it ſhould be impoſſible for any true believer to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit any deliberate ſin, and therefore he that commits any ſin, muſt not think himſelf a true believer. Beſides ſeeing Faith worketh by Charity, and Charity is the effect of Faith: certainly if the cauſe were perfect, the effect would be perfect, and conſequently as you make no degrees in Faith, ſo there would be none in Charity, and ſo no
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:57896:169"/>man could poſſibly make any progreſs in it, but all true believers ſhould be equally in Charity, as in Faith you make them equal: and from thence it would follow una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidably, that whoſoever finds in himſelf any true Faith, muſt preſently perſuade himſelf that he is perfect in Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: and whoſoever on the other ſide, diſcovers in his Charity any imperfection, muſt not believe that he hath any true Faith. Theſe you ſee are ſtrange and portentous conſequences, and yet the deduction of them from your Doctrine is clear and apparent; which ſhews this Doctrine of yours, which you would fain have true, that there might be ſome neceſſity of your Churches Infallibility, to be indeed plainly repugnant not only to Truth but even to all Religion and Piety, and fit for nothing but to make men negligent of making any Progreſs in Faith or Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. As for that one ſingle reaſon which you produce to confirm it, it will appear upon examination to be reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved finally into a groundleſs Aſſertion of your own, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to all Truth and experience, and that is, <hi>That no degree of Faith, leſs than a moſt certain and infallible know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, can be able ſufficiently to overbear our will and encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with humane probabilities, being backt with the ſtrength of Fleſh and Blood.</hi> For who ſees not that many Millions in the World forgoe many times their preſent eaſe and pleaſure, undergo great and toilſom labours, encounter great difficulties, adventure upon great dangers, and all this not upon any certain expectation, but upon a probable hope of ſome future gain and commodity, and that not infinite and Eternal, but finite and temporal? Who ſees not that many men abſtain from many things they exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly deſire, not upon any certain aſſurance, but a proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble fear of danger that may come after? What man ever was there ſo madly in love with a preſent penny, but that he would willingly ſpend it upon any little hope, that by doing ſo he might gain an hundred thouſand pound? And I would fain know <hi>what gay probabilities</hi> you could deviſe to diſſuade him from this Reſolution. And if you can deviſe none, what reaſon then, or ſenſe is there, but that
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:57896:170"/>a probable hope of infinite and Eternal Happineſs, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for all thoſe that obey <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> and much more a firm Faith, though not ſo certain, in ſome ſort, as ſenſe or ſcience, may be able to ſway our will to obedience, and encounter with all thoſe temptations which Fleſh and Blood can ſuggeſt to avert us from it? Men may therefore talk their pleaſure of an abſolute and moſt infallible certainty, but did they generally believe that obedience to Chriſt were the only way to preſent and eternal felicity, but as firmly and undoubtedly as that there is ſuch a City as <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> nay but as much as <hi>Caeſars</hi> Commentaries, or the Hiſtory of <hi>Saluſt,</hi> I believe the lives of moſt men, both <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Proteſtants</hi> would be better than they are. Thus therefore out of your own Words I argue againſt you: He that requires to true Faith, an abſolute and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible certainty, for this only Reaſon, <hi>becauſe any leſs degree could not be able to overbear our will,</hi> &amp;c. imports, that if a leſs degree of Faith were able to do this, then a leſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Faith may be true and Divine and ſaving Faith: But experience ſhews, and reaſon confirms, that a firm Faith, though not ſo certain as ſenſe or ſcience, may be able to encounter and overcome our will and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: And therefore it follows from your own reaſon, that Faith which is not a moſt certain and infallible know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge may be true and Divine and ſaving Faith.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. All theſe Reaſons I have imployed to ſhew that ſuch a moſt certain and infallible Faith as here you talk of, is not ſo neceſſary, but that without ſuch a high degree of it, it is poſſible to pleaſe God. And therefore the Doctrines delivered by you §. 25. are moſt preſumptuous and uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable: <hi>viz. That ſuch a moſt certain and Infallible Faith is neceſſary to Salvation, neceſſitate Finis, or Medii,</hi> ſo neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that <hi>after a man is come to the uſe of reaſon, no man ever was or can be ſaved without it.</hi> Wherein you boldly intrude into the judgment ſeat of God, and damn men for break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Laws, not of Gods, but your own making. But withal, you clearly contradict your ſelf, not only where you af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, <hi>That your Faith depends finally upon the Tradition of Age to Age, of Father to Son,</hi> which cannot be a fit ground,
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:57896:170"/>but only for a Moral Aſſurance; nor only, where you pretend, that <hi>not alone Hearing and Seeing,</hi> but alſo <hi>Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, Letters, Relations of many</hi> (which certainly are things not certain and infallible,) <hi>are yet Foundations good enough to ſupport your Faith;</hi> Which Doctrine, if it were good and allowable, <hi>Proteſtants</hi> might then hope that their Hiſtories and Letters and Relations might alſo paſs for means ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent of a ſufficient Certainty, and that they ſhould not be excluded from Salvation for want of ſuch a Certainty. But indeed the preſſure of the preſent difficulty compelled you to ſpeak here, what I believe you will not juſtifie, and with a pretty tergiverſation to ſhew D. <hi>Potter</hi> your means of moral certainty; whereas the Objection was that you had no means or poſſibility of infallible certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, for which you are plainly at as great a loſs and as far to ſeek as any of your Adverſaries. And therefore it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns you highly not to damn others for want of it, leſt you involve your ſelves in the ſame condemnation; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to thoſe terrible Words of S. <hi>Paul, Inexcuſabilis es,</hi> &amp;c. In this therefore you plainly contradict your ſelf. And laſtly moſt plainly, in ſaying as you do here, you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict and retract your pretence of Charity to <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in the beginning of your Book: For there you make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, that <hi>you have no aſſurance but that</hi> Proteſtants <hi>dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> Proteſtants, <hi>may poſſibly die with contrition, and be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved:</hi> And here you are very Peremptory, that <hi>they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but want a means abſolutely neceſſary to Salvation, and wanting that cannot but be damned.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="7">7. The third Condition you require to Faith, is, that our aſſent to Divine Truths ſhould <hi>not only be unknown and unevident by any humane diſcourſe,</hi> but that <hi>abſolutely al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo it ſhould be obſcure in it ſelf, and ordinarily ſpeaking, be void even of ſupernatural evidence.</hi> Which words muſt have a very favourable conſtruction, or elſe they will not be ſenſe. For who can make any thing of theſe words taken properly, that <hi>Faith muſt be an unknown unevident aſſent, or an aſſent abſolutely obſcure?</hi> I had always thought that known and unknown, obſcure and evident had been af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, not of our Aſſent, but the Object of it, not of
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:57896:171"/>our belief, but the thing believed. For well may we aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to a thing unknown, obſcure, or unevident; but that our aſſent it ſelf ſhould be called therefore unknown or obſcure, ſeems to me as great an impropriety, as if I ſhould ſay, your ſight were green or blew, becauſe you ſee ſomething that is ſo. In other places therefore I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer your words, but here I muſt anſwer your mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: which I conceive to be, That it is neceſſary to Faith that the Objects of it, the points which we believe ſhould not be ſo evidently certain, as to neceſſitate our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings to an Aſſent, that ſo their might be ſome me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in Faith, as you love to ſpeak (who will not receive no not from God himſelf, but a penny-worth for a pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,) but as we, ſome obedience in it, which can hardly have place where there is no poſſibility of diſobedience, as there is not where the underſtanding does all, and the will nothing. Now ſeeing the Religion of <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> though it be much more credible than yours, yet is not pretended to have the abſolute evidence of ſenſe or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration; therefore I might let this Doctrine paſs without exception, for any prejudice that can redound to us by it. But yet I muſt not forbear to tell you, that your diſcourſe proves indeed this condition requiſite to the merit, but yet not to the eſſence of Faith: without it Faith were not an act of obedience, but yet Faith may be Faith without it; and this you muſt confeſs, unleſs you will ſay either the Apoſtles believed not the whole Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel which they preached, or that they were not eye-wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of a great part of it: unleſs you will queſtion S. <hi>John</hi> for ſaying <hi>that which we have ſeen with our Eyes, and which our hands have handled,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>declare we unto you:</hi> nay our Saviour himſelf for ſaying, Thomas <hi>becauſe thou ſeeſt thou believeſt, Bleſſed are they which have not ſeen and yet have believed.</hi> Yet if you will ſay that in reſpect of the things which they ſaw, the Apoſtles aſſent was not pure and proper and meer Faith, but ſomewhat more; an aſſent containing Faith but ſuperadding to it, I will not contend with you, for it will be a contention about words. But then again I muſt crave leave to tell you,
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:57896:171"/>that the requiring this condition, is in my judgment a plain revocation of the former. For had you made the matter of Faith either naturally or ſupernaturally evident, it might have been a fitly attempered and duly propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned object for an abſolute certainty natural or ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural: But requiring as you do, <hi>that Faith ſhould be an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute knowledge of a thing not abſolutely known, an infallible certainty of a thing which though it is in it ſelf, yet is it not made appear to us to be infallibly certain,</hi> to my underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you ſpeak impoſſibilities. And truly for one of your Religion to do ſo, is but a good <hi>Decorum.</hi> For the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and object of your Faith being ſo full of contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, a contradictious Faith may very well become a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictious Religion. Your Faith therefore, if you pleaſe to have it ſo, let it be a free, neceſſitated, certain, uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, evident, obſcure, prudent and fooliſh, natural and ſupernatural unnatural aſſent. But they which are unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to believe nonſenſe themſelves, or to perſuade others to do ſo, it is but reaſon they ſhould make the Faith wherewith they believe, an intelligible, compoſſible, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent thing, and not define it by repugnances. Now nothing is more repugnant, than that a man ſhould be required to give moſt certain credit unto that which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be made apppear moſt certainly credible: and if it appear to him to be ſo, then is it not obſcure that it is ſo. For if you ſpeak of an acquired, rational, diſcurſive Faith, certainly theſe Reaſons which make the object ſeem cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible, muſt be the cauſe of it, and conſequently the ſtrength and firmity of my aſſent muſt riſe and fall to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the apparent credibility of the object. If you ſpeak of a ſupernatural infuſed Faith, then you ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuppoſe it infuſed by the former means, and then that which was ſaid before muſt be ſaid again: for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever effect is wrought meerly by means, muſt bear proportion to, and cannot exceed the vertue of the means, by which it is wrought: As nothing by water can be made more cold than water, nor by fire more hot than fire, nor by honey more ſweet than honey, nor by gall more bitter than gall: Or if you will ſuppoſe it infuſed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:57896:172"/>means, then that power which infuſeth into the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding aſſent which bears Analogy to ſight in the eye, muſt alſo infuſe evidence, that is, Viſibility into the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject: and look what degree of aſſent is infuſed into the underſtanding, at leaſt the ſame degree of evidence muſt be infuſed into the Object. And for you to require a ſtrength of credit beyond the appearance of the Objects credibility, is all one as if you ſhould require me to go Ten Miles an hour upon a Horſe that will go but five: to diſcern a man certainly through a miſt or cloud that makes him not certainly diſcernable; To hear a ſound more clearly than it is audible; to underſtand a thing more fully than it is intelligible: and he that doth ſo, I may well expect that his next injunction will be, that I muſt ſee ſomething that is inviſible, hear ſomething in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>audible, underſtand ſomething that is wholly unintelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. For he that demands ten of me, knowing I have but five, does in effect, as if he demanded five, knowing that I have none: and by like reaſon, you requiring that I ſhould ſee things farther than they are viſible, require I ſhould ſee ſomething inviſible, and in requiring that I believe ſomething more firmly than it is made to me evidently credible, you require in effect that I believe ſomething which appears to me incredible, and while it does ſo. I deny not but that I am bound to believe the truth of many Texts of Scripture the ſenſe whereof is to me obſcure and the Truth of many Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of Faith the manner whereof is obſcure, and to humane underſtandings incomprehenſible; But then it is to be obſerved, that not the ſenſe of ſuch Texts, not the manner of theſe things is that which I am bound to believe, but the truth of them. But that I ſhould believe the Truth of any thing, the truth whereof can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be made evident with an evidence proportionable to the degree of Faith required of me, this I ſay for any man to be bound to, is unjuſt and unreaſonable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe to do it is impoſſible.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. Ad §. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.] Yet though I deny that it is required of us to be certain in the higheſt degree,
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:57896:172"/>infallibly certain of the truth of the things which we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, for this were to know and not believe, neither is it poſſible unleſs our evidence of it, be it natural or ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural, were of the higheſt degree; yet I deny not but that we are to believe the Religion of Chriſt, we are and may be infallibly certain. For firſt, this is moſt certain, that we are in all things to do according to wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and reaſon rather than againſt it. Secondly, this is as certain, That wiſdom and reaſon require that we ſhould believe theſe things which are by many degrees more cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible and probable than the contrary. Thirdly, this is as certain, that to every man who conſiders impartially what great things may be ſaid for the truth of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and what poor things they are which may be ſaid againſt it, either for any other Religion or for none at all, it cannot but appear by many degrees more credible, that Chriſtian Religion, is true than the contrary. And from all theſe premiſes, this concluſion evidently follows, that it is infallibly certain, that we are firmly to believe the truth of Chriſtian Religion.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. Your diſcourſe therefore touching the fourth requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to Faith which is Prudence, I admit ſo far as to grant. 1. That if we were required to believe with certainty (I mean a Moral certainty,) things no way repreſented as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible and certain, (I mean Morally,) an unreaſonable obedience were required of us. And ſo likewiſe were it, were we required to believe as abſolutely certain, that which is no way repreſented to us as abſolutely certain. 2. That whom God obligeth to believe any thing, he will not fail to furniſh their underſtandings with ſuch inducements, as are ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent (it they be not negligent or perverſe) to perſuade them to believe. 3. That there is an abundance of Arguments exceedingly credible, inducing men to believe the Truth of Chriſtianity: I ſay ſo credibile, that though they cannot make us evidently ſee what we believe, yet they evidently convince that in true Wiſdom and Prudence, the Articles of it deſerve credit, and ought to be accepted as things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed by God. 4. That without ſuch reaſons and induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, our choice even of the true Faith, is not to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:57896:173"/>as prudent, but to be condemned of raſhneſs and levity.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. But then for your making Prudence, not only a commendation of a believer, and a juſtification of his Faith, but alſo eſſential to it, and part of the definition of it, in that, queſtionleſs you were miſtaken, and have done as if being to ſay what a man is, you ſhould define him, A Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable creature that hath skill in Aſtronomy. For as all Aſtronomers are men, but all men are not Aſtronomers, and therefore Aſtronomy ought not to be put into the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition of men, where nothing ſhould have place, but what agrees to all men: So though all that are truly wiſe (that is, wiſe for Eternity,) will believe aright, yet many may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve aright which are not wiſe. I could wiſh with all my Heart as <hi>Moſes</hi> did, <hi>that all the Lords People could Propheſie:</hi> That all that believe the true Religion <hi>were able</hi> (according to S. <hi>Peters</hi> injunction) <hi>to give a reaſon of the hope that is in them,</hi> a reaſon why they hope for Eternal Happineſs by this way rather than any other! neither do I think it any great difficulty that men of ordinary capacities, if they would give their mind to it, might quickly be enabled to do ſo. But ſhould I affirm that all true believers can do ſo, I ſuppoſe it would be as much againſt experience and modeſty, as it is againſt Truth and Charity, to ſay as you do, that <hi>they which cannot do ſo, either are not at all, or to no purpoſe true believers.</hi> And thus we ſee that the foundations you build upon, are ruinous and deceitful, and ſo unfit to ſupport your Fabrick that they deſtroy one another. I come now to ſhew that your Arguments to prove <hi>Proteſtants Hereticks</hi> are all of the ſame quality with your former grounds: which I will do by oppoſing clear and ſatisfying Anſwers in order to them.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. Ad §. 13.) To the firſt then, delivered by you §. 13. <hi>That</hi> Proteſtants <hi>muſt be</hi> Hereticks, <hi>becauſe they oppoſed divers Truths propounded for Divine by the Viſible Church:</hi> I Anſwer, It is not <hi>Hereſie</hi> to oppoſe any Truth propounded by the Church, but only ſuch a Truth as is an eſſential part of the Goſpel of Chriſt. 2. The Doctrines which <hi>Proteſtants</hi> oppoſed, were not Truths, but
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:57896:173"/>plain and impious falſhoods: Neither thirdly, were they propounded as Truths by the Viſible Church, but only by a Part of it, and that a corrupted Part.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. Ad §. 14. The next <hi>Argument, in the next Particle tells us,</hi> That <hi>every error againſt any doctrin revealed by God is damnable Hereſie: Now either Proteſtants or the</hi> Roman <hi>Church muſt err againſt the word of God: But the</hi> Roman <hi>Church</hi> we <hi>grant (perforce) doth not err damnably, neither can ſhe, becauſe ſhe is the Catholick Church, which</hi> we (you ſay) <hi>confeſs cannot err damnably: Therefore Proteſtants muſt err a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Gods word, and conſequently are guilty of formal Hereſie.</hi> Whereunto I anſwer plainly, that there be in this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment almoſt as many falſhoods as aſſertions. For neither is every error againſt any Doctrin revealed by God a damnable Hereſie, unleſs it be revealed publickly, and plainly with a command that all ſhould believe it. 2. D. <hi>Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> no where grants, that the Errors of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church are <hi>not in themſelves damnable,</hi> though he hopes by accident they may not actually damn ſome men amongſt you: and this you your ſelf confeſs in divers places of your book, where you tell us, that he <hi>allows no hope of Salvation to thoſe amongſt you, whom ignorance cannot excuſe.</hi> 3. You beg the Queſtion twice in taking for granted, Firſt that <hi>the</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <hi>Church is the truly Catholick Church;</hi> which with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much favour can hardly paſs for a part of it: And again, that the <hi>Catholick Church cannot fall into any error of it ſelf damnable:</hi> for it may do ſo, and ſtill be the Catholick Church, if it retain thoſe Truths which may be an anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dote againſt the malignity of this error, to thoſe that held it out of a ſimple un-affected ignorance. Laſtly, though the thing be true, yet I might well require ſome proof of it from you, that either <hi>Proteſtants</hi> or the <hi>Roman</hi> Church muſt err againſt Gods word. For if their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction be your only reaſon, then alſo you or the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minicans</hi> muſt be <hi>Hereticks,</hi> becauſe you contradict one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother as much as <hi>Proteſtants</hi> and <hi>Papiſts.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="13">13. Ad §. 15. The third Argument pretends that <hi>you have ſhewed already, that the Viſible Church is Judge of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies, and therefore Infallible; from whence you ſuppoſe that
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:57896:174"/>it follows, that to oppoſe her, is to oppoſe God.</hi> To which I anſwer, that you have ſaid onely, and not ſhewed that <hi>the Viſible Church is Judge of Controverſies.</hi> And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed how can ſhe be judge of them if ſhe cannot decide them? And how can ſhe decide them, if it be a queſtion whether ſhe be judge of them? That which is queſtioned it ſelf, cannot with any ſenſe be pretended to be fit to decide other queſtions; and much leſs this queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whether it have Authority to judge and decide all que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions? 2. If ſhe were judge, it would not follow that ſhe were infallible, for we have many Judges in our Courts of Judicature, yet none infallible. Nay you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not with any modeſty deny, that every man in the world ought to judge for himſelf, what Religion is trueſt, and yet you will not ſay that every man is infallible. 3. If the Church were ſuppoſed Infallible, yet it would not follow at all, much leſs manifeſtly, that to oppoſe her declaration is to oppoſe God: unleſs you ſuppoſe alſo that as ſhe is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, ſo by her oppoſers, ſhe is known or believed to be ſo. Laſtly, If all this were true (as it is all moſt falſe) yet were it to little purpoſe, ſeeing you have omitted to prove that the Viſible Church is the <hi>Roman.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="14">14. Ad §. 16. Inſtead of a fourth Argument this is preſented to us, <hi>That if</hi> Luther <hi>were an Heretick, then they that agreed with him muſt be ſo.</hi> And that <hi>Luther</hi> was a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Heretick, you endeavor to prove by this moſt formal Syllogiſm; <hi>To ſay the Viſible Church is not Univerſal, is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly an Hereſie: but</hi> Luthers <hi>Reformation was not Univerſal, Therefore it cannot be excuſed from formal Hereſie.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto I Anſwer, firſt to the firſt part, that it is no way im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that <hi>Luther,</hi> had he been the inventer and firſt broacher of a falſe Doctrin, (as he was not) might have been a formal Heretick, and yet that thoſe who follow him may be only ſo materially and improperly, and indeed no Hereticks. Your own men out of S. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh between <hi>Haeretici &amp; Haereticorum ſequaces:</hi> And you your ſelf though you pronounce <hi>the leaders among the</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians <hi>formal Hereticks,</hi> yet confeſs that <hi>Salvian</hi> was at leaſt doubtful whether theſe <hi>Arrians,</hi> who in ſimplicity follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:57896:174"/>their Teachers, might not be excuſed by ignorance. And about this ſuſpenſion of his you alſo ſeem ſuſpended, for you neither approve nor condemn it. Secondly, to the ſecond part I ſay, that had you not preſumed upon our ignorance in Logick as well as Metaphyſicks and School Divinity, you would never have obtruded upon us this rope of ſand for a formal Syllogiſm. It is even Couſin-German to this, To deny the Reſurrection is properly an Hereſie, But <hi>Luthers</hi> Reformation was not Univerſal, Therefore it cannot be excuſed from formal Hereſie! Or to this, To ſay the Viſible Church is not Univerſal is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly an Hereſie: But the preaching of the Goſpel at the beginning was not Univerſal; therefore it cannot be excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from formal Hereſie. For as he whoſe Reformation is but particular, may yet not deny the Reſurrection, ſo may he alſo not deny the Churches Univerſality. And as the Apoſtles who preached the Goſpel in the beginning, did believe the Church Univerſal, though their preaching at the beginning was not ſo: So <hi>Luther</hi> alſo might and did believe the Church Univerſal, though his Reformation were but particular. I ſay he did believe it Univerſal, even in your own ſenſe, that is, Univerſal <hi>de jure,</hi> though not <hi>de facto.</hi> And as for univerſality in fact, he believed the Church much more Univerſal than his Reformation: For he did conceive (as appears by your own Allegations out of him) that only the Part reformed was the true Church, but alſo that they were Part of it who needed reformation. Neither did he ever pretend to make a new Church but to reform the old one. Thirdly and laſtly, to the firſt propoſition of this unſyllogiſtical ſyllogiſm, I anſwer, That to ſay the true Church is not always <hi>de facto</hi> univerſal, is ſo far from being an Hereſie, that it is a certain Truth known to all thoſe that know the world, and what Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions poſſeſs far the greater part of it. <hi>Donatus</hi> therefore was not to blame, for ſaying, that the Church might poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly be confined to <hi>Africk;</hi> but for ſaying without ground, that then it was ſo. And S. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> as he was in the right, in thinking that the Church was then extended farther than <hi>Africk;</hi> ſo was he in the wrong if he thought that
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:57896:175"/>of neceſſity it always muſt be ſo; but moſt palpably mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken in conceiving that it was then ſpread over the whole earth, and known to all nations, which if paſſion did not trouble you, and make you forget how lately al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt half the world was diſcovered, and in what eſtate it was then found, you would very eaſily ſee and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs.</p>
                     <p n="16">16. <hi>The</hi> Donatiſts <hi>might do ill in calling the Chair of</hi> Rome <hi>the Chair of Peſtilence, and the</hi> Roman <hi>Church an Harlot,</hi> and yet the ſtate of the Church being altered, <hi>Proteſtants</hi> might do well to do ſo, and therefore though, <hi>S.</hi> Auſtin <hi>might perhaps have reaſon to perſecute the</hi> Donatiſts <hi>for detra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting from the Church,</hi> and calling her Harlot, when ſhe was not ſo; yet you may have none to threaten D. <hi>Potter</hi> that you would perſecute him (as the Application of this place intimates you would,) if it were in your power: plainly ſhewing that you are a curſt Cow though your horns be ſhort, ſeeing the <hi>Roman</hi> Church is not now what it was in S. <hi>Auſtins</hi> time. And hereof the concluſion of your own book affords us a very pregnant teſtimony: where you tell us out of Saint <hi>Auſtin,</hi> that one grand im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment, which among many kept the ſeduced followers of the faction of <hi>Donatus</hi> from the Churches Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, was a viſible calumny raiſed againſt the Catholicks, that <hi>they did ſet ſome ſtrange thing upon their Altar. To how many</hi> (ſaith Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi>) <hi>did the reports of ill Tongues ſhut up the way to enter, who ſaid, that we put, I know not what upon the Altar?</hi> Out of deteſtation of the calumny, and juſt indignation againſt it, he would not ſo much as name the impiety wherewith they were charged, and therefore by a Rhetorical figure calls it, <hi>I know not what.</hi> But compare with him <hi>Optatus,</hi> writing of the ſame mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and you ſhall plainly perceive that this <hi>(I know not what)</hi> pretended to be ſet upon the Altar, was indeed a picture, which the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> (knowing how deteſtable a thing it was to all Chriſtians at that time, to ſet up any pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures in a Church to worſhip them, as your new faſhion is) bruited abroad to be done in the Churches of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church. But what anſwer do S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> and <hi>Optatus</hi>
                        <pb n="341" facs="tcp:57896:175"/>make to this accuſation? Do they confeſs and maintain it? Do they ſay, as you would now, It is true we do ſet Pictures upon our Altar, and that not only for ornament or memory, but for worſhip alſo; but we do well to do ſo, and this ought not to trouble you, or affright you from our Communion? What other anſwer your Church could now make to ſuch an objection, is very hard to imagine: And therefore were your Doctrin the ſame with the Doctrin of the Fathers in this point, they muſt have anſwered ſo likewiſe. But they to the contrary not only deny the crime, but abhor and deteſt it. To little purpoſe therefore do you hunt after theſe poor ſhadows of reſemblances between us and the <hi>Donatiſts:</hi> unleſs you could ſhew an exact re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance between the preſent Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and the Ancient: which ſeeing by this, and many other particulars it is demonſtrated to be impoſſible; that Church which was then a Virgin may be now a Harlot, and that which was detraction in the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> may be in <hi>Proteſtants</hi> a juſt accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation.</p>
                     <p n="18">18. But the main point you ſay is, that <hi>ſince</hi> Luthers <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Church was not in being for divers Centuries before</hi> Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>and yet was in the Apoſtles time, they muſt of neceſſity affirm heretically with the</hi> Donatiſts, <hi>that the true unſpotted Church of Chriſt periſhed, and that ſhe which remained on earth, was</hi> (O <hi>Blaſphemy!</hi>) <hi>an Harlot.</hi> By which words it ſeems you are reſolute perpetually to confound <hi>True</hi> and <hi>Unſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;</hi> and to put no difference between a corrupted Church and none at all. But what is this, but to make no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between a diſeaſed and a dead man? Nay what is it but to contradict your ſelves, who cannot deny but that ſins are as great ſtains and ſpots and deformities in the ſight of God, as errors; and confeſs your Church to be a Congregation of men, whereof every particular, not one excepted, (and conſequently the generality which is nothing but a collection of them) is polluted and defiled with ſin?</p>
                     <p n="19">19. You ask, How <hi>can the Church more truly be ſaid to periſh, than when ſhe is permitted to maintain a damnable Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie?</hi> I Anſwer, ſhe may be more truly ſaid to periſh, when
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:57896:176"/>ſhe is not only permitted to do ſo, but <hi>de facto</hi> doth main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a damnable Hereſie. Again, ſhe may be more truly ſaid to periſh, when ſhe falls into an Hereſie, which is not only damnable in it ſelf, and <hi>ex natura rei,</hi> as you ſpeak, but ſuch an Hereſie, the belief of whoſe contrary Truth is neceſſary, not only <hi>neceſſitate praecepti</hi> but <hi>medii,</hi> and therefore the Hereſie ſo abſolutely and indiſpenſably deſtructive of ſalvation, that no ignorance can excuſe it, nor any general repentance, without a dereliction of it, can beg a pardon for it. Such an hereſie if the Church ſhould fall into, it might be more truly ſaid to periſh, than if it fell only into ſome hereſie of its own nature damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. For in that ſtate all the members of it, without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, all without mercy muſt needs periſh for ever: In this, although thoſe that might ſee the truth and would not, cannot upon any good ground hope for ſalvation, yet without queſtion, it might ſend many ſouls to heaven, who would gladly have embraced the Truth, but that they wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted means to diſcover it. Thirdly and laſtly, ſhe may yet more truly be ſaid to periſh when ſhe Apoſtates from Chriſt abſolutely, or rejects even thoſe Truths out of which her Hereſies may be reformed; as if ſhe ſhould directly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Jeſus to be the Chriſt,</hi> or the Scripture to be the Word of God. Towards which ſtate of Perdition it may well be feared that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth ſomewhat incline, by her ſuperinducing upon the reſt of her Errors the Doctrin of her own Infallibility, whereby her errors are made in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable; and by her pretending that the Scripture is to be interpreted according to her doctrin, and not her doctrin to be judged of by Scripture, whereby ſhe makes the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture uneffectuall for her Reformation.</p>
                     <p n="20">20. Ad §. 18. I was very glad when I heard you ſay <hi>The Holy Scripture and ancient Fathers do aſſign Separation from the Viſible Church as a mark of Hereſie:</hi> for I was in good hope, that no Chriſtian would ſo belie the Scripture, as to ſay ſo of it, unleſs he could have produced ſome one Text at leaſt, wherein this was plainly affirmed, or from whence it might be undoubtedly and undeniably collected. For aſſure your ſelf, good Sir, it is a very heinous crime
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:57896:176"/>to ſay, <hi>thus ſaith the Lord, when the Lord doth not ſay ſo.</hi> I expected therefore ſome Scripture ſhould have been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, wherein it ſhould have been ſaid, <hi>whoſoever ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates from the</hi> Roman <hi>Church is an Heretick:</hi> or <hi>the</hi> Roman <hi>Church is infallible,</hi> or <hi>the guide of Faith:</hi> or at leaſt, <hi>There ſhall be always ſome Viſible Church infallible in matters of Faith.</hi> Some ſuch direction as this I hoped for: And I pray con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider whether I had not reaſon! The Evangeliſts and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles who wrote the New Teſtament, we all ſuppoſe were good men, and very deſirous to direct us the ſureſt and plaineſt way to Heaven; we ſuppoſe them likewiſe very ſufficiently inſtructed by the Spirit of God in all the neceſſary points of the Chriſtian Faith, and therefore cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly not ignorant of this <hi>Unum Neceſſarium,</hi> this moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary point of all others, without which as you pretend and teach, all faith is no Faith, that is, that <hi>the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>was deſigned by God the guide of Faith.</hi> We ſuppoſe them laſtly wiſe men, eſpecially being aſſiſted by the ſpirit of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and ſuch as knew that a doubtful and queſtionable guide was for mens direction as good as none at all. And after all theſe ſuppoſitions, which I preſume no good Chriſtian will call into queſtion, is it poſſible that any Chriſtian heart can believe, that not one amongſt them all ſhould <hi>ad rei memoriam</hi> write this neceſſary doctrin plainly ſo much as once? Certainly in all reaſon they had provided much better for the good of Chriſtians if they had wrote this, though they had writ nothing elſe. Methinks the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſts undertaking to write the Goſpel of Chriſt, could not poſſibly have omitted, any one of them, this moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary point of faith, had they known it neceſſary, (S. <hi>Luke</hi> eſpecially, who plainly profeſſeth that <hi>his intent was to write all things neceſſary.</hi>) Methinks S. <hi>Paul</hi> writing to the <hi>Romans</hi> could not but have congratulated this their Priviledge to them! Methinks inſtead of ſaying, <hi>Your Faith is ſpoken of all the world over</hi> (which you have no reaſon to be very proud of, for he ſays the very ſame thing to the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi>) he could not have failed to have told them once at leaſt in plain terms, that <hi>their Faith was the Rule for all the World for ever.</hi> But then ſure he would have forborn to put them
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:57896:177"/>in fear of an impoſſibility, as he doth in his eleventh Chap. that they alſo, nay the whole Church of the <hi>Gentiles if they did not look to their ſtanding, might fall away to infidelity</hi> as the <hi>Jews</hi> had done. Methinks in all his other Epiſtles, at leaſt in ſome, at leaſt in one of them, he could not have failed to have given the world this direction, had he known it to be a true one, that <hi>all men were to be guided by the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>and none to ſeparate from it under pain of damnation.</hi> Methinks writing ſo often of Hereticks and Antichriſt, he ſhould have given the world this (as you pretend) only ſure preſervative from them. How was it poſſible that S. <hi>Peter</hi> writing two Catholick Epiſtles, mentioning his own departure, writing to preſerve Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians in the Faith, ſhould in neither of them commend them to the guidance of his pretended Succeſſors, the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of <hi>Rome?</hi> How was it poſſible that S. <hi>James,</hi> and S. <hi>Jude</hi> in their Catholick Epiſtles ſhould not give this Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick direction? Methinks S. <hi>John</hi> inſtead of ſaying, <hi>he that believeth that Jeſus is the Chriſt, is born of God,</hi> (The force of which direction, your gloſſes do quite enervate, and make unavailable to diſcern who are the ſons of God,) ſhould have ſaid, <hi>He that adheres to the doctrin of the</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <hi>Church, and lives according to it, he is a good Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, and by this Mark ye ſhall know him!</hi> What man not quite out of his wits, if he conſider as he ſhould, the pretended neceſſity of this doctrin, that without the belief hereof no man ordinarily can be ſaved, can poſſibly force himſelf to conceive that all theſe good and holy men, ſo deſirous of mens ſalvation, and ſo well aſſured of it (as it is pretended,) ſhould be ſo deeply and affectedly ſilent in it, and not one ſay it plainly ſo much as once, but leave it to be collected from uncertain principles, by many more uncertain conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences? Certainly he that can judge ſo uncharitably of them, it is no marvel if he cenſure other inferior ſervants of Chriſt as Atheiſts, and Hypocrites, and what he pleaſes. Plain places therefore I did and had reaſon to look for, when I heard you ſay, <hi>the holy Scripture aſſigns Separation from the viſible Church as a mark of Hereſie.</hi> But inſtead hereof what
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:57896:177"/>have you brought us, but meer impertinences? S. <hi>John</hi> ſaith of ſome who pretended to be Chriſtians and were not ſo, and therefore when it was for their advantage forſook their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, <hi>They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us.</hi> Of ſome, who before the decree of the Council to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, were perſuaded and accordingly taught, that the convert Gentiles were to keep the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> it is ſaid in the <hi>Acts, Some who went out from us.</hi> And again S. <hi>Paul</hi> in the ſame Book forewarns the <hi>Epheſians</hi> that <hi>out of them ſhould ariſe men ſpeaking perverſe things.</hi> And from theſe places which it ſeems are the plaineſt you have, you collect <hi>that ſeparation from the Viſible Church is aſſigned by Scripture as a Mark of</hi> Hereſie. Which is certainly a ſtrange and unheard of ſtrain of Logick. Unleſs you will ſay that every Text wherein it is ſaid, that ſome Body goes out from ſome Body, affords an Argument for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe! For the firſt place there is no certainty that it ſpeaks of <hi>Hereticks,</hi> but, <hi>no Chriſtians,</hi> of <hi>Antichriſts, of ſuch as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied Jeſus to be the Chriſt:</hi> See the place and you ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs as much. The ſecond place, it is certain, you muſt not ſay it ſpeaks of <hi>Hereticks,</hi> for it ſpeaks only of ſome who believed and taught an Error, while it was yet a queſtion and not evident, and therefore according to your Doctrine, no formal <hi>Hereſie.</hi> The third ſays indeed, that of the Profeſſors of Chriſtianity, ſome ſhall ariſe that ſhall teach <hi>Hereſie:</hi> But not one of them all that ſays or inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates, that whoſoever ſeparates from the Viſible Church, in what ſtate ſoever, is certainly an <hi>Heretick. Hereticks</hi> I confeſs do always do ſo; But they that do ſo are not always <hi>Hereticks,</hi> for perhaps the State of the Church may make it neceſſary for them to do ſo; as Rebels always diſobey the command of their King, yet they which diſobey a Kings Command (which perhaps may be unjuſt) are not preſently Rebels.</p>
                     <p n="22">22. In the 19. §. We have the Authority of eight Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers urged to prove <hi>that the ſeparation from the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>as it is the Sea of S.</hi> Peter (I conceive you mean as it is the Particular Church) <hi>is the mark of</hi> Hereſie. Which kind of Argument I might well refuſe to anſwer,
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:57896:178"/>unleſs you would firſt promiſe me, that whenſoever I ſhould produce as plain ſentences, of as great a number of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as Ancient, for any Doctrine whatſoever, that you will ſubſcribe to it, though it fall out to be contrary to the Doctrine of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. For I conceive nothing in the World more unequal or unreaſonable, than that you ſhould preſs us with ſuch Authorities as theſe, and think your ſelves at liberty from them; and that you ſhould ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count them Fathers when they are for you, and Children when they are againſt you. Yet I would not you ſhould interpret this as if I had not great aſſurance, that it is not poſſible for you ever to gain this cauſe at the Tribunal of the Fathers, nay not of the Fathers whoſe ſentences are here alledged. Let us conſider them in order, and I doubt not to make it appear that far the greater part of them, nay all of them that are nay way conſiderable fall ſhort of your purpoſe.</p>

Conſider again, that he ſays only, that <hi>he was then in Communion with the Chair of</hi> Peter, Not that he always would, or of neceſſity muſt be ſo: for his reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the contrary is too evident out of that which he ſaith elſewhere which ſhall be produced hereafter.

And ſo likewiſe the reſt of his expreſſions (if we mean to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile <hi>Hierome</hi> with <hi>Hierome</hi>) muſt be conceived as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by him, of that Biſhop and Sea of <hi>Rome,</hi> at that preſent time, and in the preſent State, and in reſpect of that Doctrine which he there intreats of. For otherwiſe had he conceived it neceſſary for him and all men to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form their judgements in matters of Faith, to the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Biſhop and Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> how came it to paſs that he choſe rather to believe the Epiſtle to the

Though we do not altogether deny, but that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> might be called the <hi>Chair of S.</hi> Peter, in regard he is ſaid to have Preached the Goſpel there; and the <hi>princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Church,</hi> becauſe the City was the principal and impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial City, which prerogative of the City, if we believe the Fathers of the Council of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> was the ground and occaſion, why the Fathers of former times (I pray obſerve) conferred upon this Church this prerogative above other Churches.</p>

                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> This does not prove that to Communicate with the Church and <hi>Pope</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and to Communicate with the <hi>Catholick</hi> Church, is <hi>always</hi> (for that you aſſume) one and the ſame thing. S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſpeaks not of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> at all, but of the Biſhop only, who when he doth Communicate with the <hi>Catholick</hi> Church, as <hi>Cornelius</hi> at that time did, then whoſoever Communicates with him, cannot but Communicate with the <hi>Catholick</hi> Church: and then by accident one may truely ſay, ſuch a one Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates with you, that is, with the <hi>Catholick</hi> Church, and that to Communicate with him is to Communicate with the <hi>Catholick</hi> Church. As if <hi>Titius</hi> and <hi>Sempronius</hi> be together, he that is in company with <hi>Titius,</hi> cannot but be at that time in company with <hi>Sempronius.</hi> As if a General be marching to ſome place with an Army, he that then is with the General muſt at that time be with the Army: And a man may ſay without abſurdity, ſuch a time I was with the General, that is, with the Army, and that to be with the General is to be with the Army. Or as if a mans hand be joyned to his Body, the finger which is joyned to the hand is joyned to the Body, and a man may ſay truly of it, this finger is joyned to the hand, that is, to the Body, and to be joyned to the hand is to be joyned to the Body; becauſe all theſe things are by accident true. And yet I hope you would not deny,
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:57896:180"/>but the finger might poſſibly be joyned to the hand, and yet not to the Body, the hand being cut off from the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; and a man might another time, be with his General and not with his Army, he being abſent from the Army. And therefore by like Reaſon your collection is Sophiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, being in effect but this, to communicate with ſuch a Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> who did Communicate with the <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick</hi> Church, was to Communicate with the <hi>Catholick</hi> Church, therefore abſolutely and always it muſt be true, that to Communicate with him, is by conſequent to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with the <hi>Catholick</hi> Church, and to be divided from the Communion, is to be an <hi>Heretick.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Though at the firſt, hearing the Glorious At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes here given (and that juſtly) to the Church of <hi>Rome, the confounding</hi> Hereticks <hi>with her Tradition, and ſaying it is neceſſary for all Churches to reſort to her,</hi> may ſound like Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments for you: yet he that is attentive I hope will eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcover, that it might be good and rational in <hi>Irenaeus</hi> having to do with Hereticks, who, ſomewhat like thoſe who would be the only <hi>Catholicks,</hi> declining a tryal by Scripture as not containing the Truth of Chriſt perfectly, and not fit to decide Controverſies without recourſe to Tradition: I ſay he will eaſily perceive that it might be rational in <hi>Irenaeus</hi> to urge them with any Tradition of more credit than their own, eſpecially a Tradition conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to Scripture, and even contained in it; and yet that
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:57896:181"/>it may be irrational in you to urge us, who do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline Scripture but appeal to it as a perfect rule of Faith, with a Tradition which we pretend is many ways repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to Scripture, and repugnant to a Tradition far more general than it ſelf, which gives teſtimony to Scripture, and laſtly repugnant to it ſelf as giving atteſtation both to Scripture and to Doctrines plainly contrary to Scripture. Secondly, that the Authority of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church was then a far greater Argument of the Truth of her Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion when it was United with all other Apoſtolick Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, than now when it is divided from them, according to that of <hi>Tertullian, Had the Churches Erred they would have varied, but that which is the ſame in all, cannot be Error but Tradition;</hi> and therefore though <hi>Irenaeus</hi> his Argument may be very probable, yet yours may be worth nothing. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that fourteen hundred years may have made a great deal of alteration in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church: as Rivers, though near the Fountain they may retain their native and unmixt ſincerity, yet in long Progreſs cannot but take in much mixture that came not from the Fountain. And therefore the <hi>Roman</hi> Tradition though then pure, may now be corrupt and impure: and ſo this Argument (being one of thoſe things which are the worſe for wearing) might in <hi>Irenaeus</hi> his time be ſtrong and vigorous, and after declin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and decaying may long ſince have fallen to nothing. Eſpecially conſidering that <hi>Irenaeus</hi> plays the Hiſtorian on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and not the Prophet, and ſays only, that the <hi>Apoſtolick Tradition had been always there as in other Apoſtolick Churches conſerved or obſerved,</hi> chooſe you whether, but that <hi>it ſhould be always ſo</hi> he ſays not, neither had he any warrant. He knew well enough that there was foretold a <hi>great falling away of</hi> the Churches of Chriſt to Antichriſt: that the <hi>Roman</hi> Church in particular was forewarned that ſhe alſo, <hi>nay the whole Church of the Gentiles, might fall if they look not to their ſtanding:</hi> and therefore to ſecure her that ſhe ſhould ſtand for ever, he had no reaſon, nor Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. Fourthly, that it appears manifeſtly out of this Book of <hi>Irenaeus</hi> quoted by you, that the Doctrine of the <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaſts</hi> was in his Judgment Apoſtolick Tradition, as alſo
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:57896:181"/>it was eſteemed (for ought appears to the contrary) by all the Doctors, and Saints, and Martyrs of or about his time, for all that ſpeak of it, or whoſe judgments in the point are any way recorded, are for it: and <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> profeſſeth that <hi>all good and Orthodox Chriſtians of his time believed it,</hi> and thoſe that did not, he reckons amongſt Hereticks. Now I demand, was this Tradition one of thoſe that was conſerved, and obſerved in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> or was it not? If not, had <hi>Iraeneus</hi> known ſo much, he muſt have retracted this commendation of that Church. If it was, then the Tradition of the preſent Church of <hi>Rome</hi> contradicts the Ancient, and accounts it Heretical, and then ſure it can be no certain note of Hereſie to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from them, who have departed from themſelves, and prove themſelves ſubject unto error by holding contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. Fifthly and laſtly, that out of the Story of the Church it is as manifeſt as the light at noon, that though <hi>Iraeneus</hi> did eſteem the <hi>Roman</hi> Tradition, a great Argument of the Doctrin which he there delivers and defends againſt the Hereticks of his time, <hi>viz. that there was one God,</hi> yet he was very far from thinking that Church was, and ever ſhould be a ſafe keeper, and an infallible witneſs of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition in general: Inaſmuch as in his own life, his action proclaimed the contrary. For when <hi>Victor</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> obtruded the <hi>Roman</hi> Tradition touching the time of <hi>Eaſter</hi> upon the <hi>Aſian</hi> Biſhops under the pain of Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>and damnation, Iraeneus,</hi> and all the other Weſtern Biſhops, though agreeing with him in his obſervation yet ſharply reprehended him for Excommunicating the <hi>Aſian</hi> Biſhops for their diſagreeing, plainly ſhewing, that they eſteemed that not a neceſſary doctrin and a ſufficient ground of excommunication, which the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> and his adherents did ſo account of: For otherwiſe how could they have reprehended him for excommunicating them, had they conceived the cauſe of his excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion juſt and ſufficient? And beſides evidently declaring that they eſteemed not ſeparation from the <hi>Roman</hi> Church a certain mark of Hereſie, ſeeing they eſteemed not them Hereticks though ſeparated and cut off from the <hi>Roman</hi> Church.</p>

<pb n="359" facs="tcp:57896:184"/>as to perſuade me, that I am not ſure that I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve all this, I deſire you to tell me, how are you ſure that you believe the Church of <hi>Rome?</hi> For if a man may perſuade himſelf he doth believe what he doth not believe, then may you think you believe the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and yet not believe it. But if no man can Err concerning what he believes, then you muſt give me leave to aſſure my ſelf that I do believe, and conſequently that any man may believe the aforeſaid truths upon the aforeſaid motives, without any dependence upon any Succeſſion that hath believed it always. And as from your definition of Faith, ſo from your definition of Hereſie, this fancy may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed. For queſtionleſs no man can be an Heretick but he that holds an Hereſie, and an Hereſie you ſay <hi>is a Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary Error;</hi> therefore no man can be neceſſitated to be an Heretick whether he will or no, by want of ſuch a thing that is not in his power to have: But that there ſhould have been a perpetual Succeſſion of Believers in all points Orthodox, is not a thing which is in your power, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our being or not being Hereticks depends not on it. Beſides, what is more certain, than that he may make a ſtreight line, who hath a Rule to make it by, though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver man in the World had made any before: and why then may not he that believes the Scripture to be the Word of God, and the Rule of Faith, regulate his Faith by it, and conſequently believe aright without much regarding what other men either will do or have done? It is true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed there is a neceſſity that if God will have his Words believed, he by his Providence muſt take order, that either by Succeſſion of men, or by ſome other means natural or ſupernatural, it be preſerved and delivered, and ſufficiently notified to be his Word; but that this ſhould be done by a Succeſſion of men that holds no Error againſt it, certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there is no more neceſſity, than that it ſhould be done by a Succeſſion of men that commit no ſin againſt it. For if men may preſerve the Records of a Law, and yet tranſgreſs it, certainly they may alſo preſerve directions for their Faith, and yet not follow them. I doubt not but Lawyers at the Barr do find by frequent experience,
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:57896:185"/>that many men preſerve and produce evidences, which being examined oftimes make againſt themſelves. This they do ignorantly, it being in their power to ſuppreſs, or perhaps to alter them. And why then ſhould any man conceive it ſtrange, that an erroneous and corrupted Church ſhould preſerve and deliver the Scriptures uncorrupted, when indeed for many reaſons which I have formally al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leged, it was impoſſible for them to corrupt them? Seeing therefore this is all the neceſſity that is pretended of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Succeſſion of men Orthodox in all points, certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there is no neceſſity at all of any ſuch, neither can the want of it prove any man or any Church Heretical.</p>
                     <p n="39">39. When therefore you have produced ſome proof of this, (which was your Major in your former Syllogiſm,) That want of Succeſſion is a certain mark of Hereſie, you ſhall then receive a full anſwer to your Minor. We ſhall then conſider whether your indelible Character be any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality, or whether it be a Creature of your own making, a fancy of your own imagination? And if it be a thing, and not only a Word, whether our Biſhops and Prieſts have it not as well as yours; and whether ſome mens perſuaſion that there is no ſuch thing, can hinder them from having it, or prove that they have it not if there be any ſuch thing? (Any more than a mans perſuaſion that he has not taken Phyſick or Poyſon, will make him not to have taken it if he has, or hinder the operation of it?) And whether <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> in the place quoted by you, ſpeak of a Prieſt made a Lay-man, by a juſt depoſition or degradation, and not by a voluntary deſertion of his Order? And whether in the ſame place he ſet not ſome mark upon Hereticks that will agree to your Church? Whether all the Authority of our Biſhops in <hi>England</hi> before the Reformation, was confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red on them by the <hi>Pope?</hi> And if it were, whether it were the <hi>Popes</hi> right, or an Uſurpation? If it were his right, whether by Divine Law or Eccleſiaſtical? And if by Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical only, whether he might poſſibly ſo abuſe his power, as to deſerve to loſe it? Whether <hi>de facto</hi> he had done ſo? Whether ſuppoſing he had deſerved to loſe it, thoſe that deprived him of it had power to take it from
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:57896:185"/>him? Or if not, whether they had power to ſuſpend him from the uſe of it, until good caution were put in, and good aſſurance given, that if he had it again, he would not abuſe it as he had formerly done? Whether in caſe they had done unlawfully that took his power from him, it may not (things being now ſetled, and the preſent Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment eſtabliſhed) be as unlawful to go about to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore it? whether it be not a Fallacy to conclude, becauſe we believe the <hi>Pope</hi> hath no power in <hi>England,</hi> now when the King and State and Church hath deprived him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on juſt grounds of it, therefore we cannot believe that he had any before his deprivation? Whether without Schiſm, a man may not withdraw obedience from an Uſurped Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority commanding unlawful things? Whether the <hi>Roman</hi> Church might not give Authority to Biſhops and Prieſts to oppoſe her Errors, as well as a King gives Authority to a Judge to judge againſt him, if his cauſe be bad; as well as <hi>Trajan</hi> gave his Sword to his Prefect, with this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, that <hi>if he Governed well, he ſhould uſe it for him, if ill againſt.</hi> Whether the <hi>Roman</hi> Church gave not Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to her Biſhops and Prieſts to Preach againſt her cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions in manners? And if ſo, why not againſt her Errors in Doctrine, if ſhe had any? Whether ſhe gave them not Authority to Preach the whole Goſpel of Chriſt, and conſequently againſt her Doctrine, if it ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict any part of the Goſpel of Chriſt? Whether it be not acknowledged lawful in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> for any Lay-man or Woman that has ability to perſuade others by Word or by Writing from Error, and unto truth? And why this Liberty may not be practiſed againſt their Religion, if it be falſe, as well as for it if it be true? Whether any man need any other Commiſſion or Vocation than that of a Chriſtian, to do a work of Charity? And whether it be not one of the greateſt works of Charity (if it be done after a peaceable manner, and without any unneceſſary diſturbance of order,) to perſuade men out of a falſe, unto a true way of Eternal happineſs? Eſpecially the Apoſtle having aſſured us, that he, (whoſoever he is) <hi>who convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a ſinner from the Error of his way, ſhall ſave a Soul from
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:57896:186"/>Death, and ſhall hide a multitude of Sins?</hi> Whether the firſt Reformed Biſhops died all at once, ſo that there were not enough to ordain others in the places that were va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant? Whether the Biſhops of <hi>England</hi> may not Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate a Metropolitan of <hi>England,</hi> as well as the Cardinals do the <hi>Pope?</hi> whether the King or Queen of <hi>England,</hi> or they that have the Government in their Hands, in the minority of the Prince, may not lawfully commend one to them to be conſecrated, againſt whom there is no Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonical exception? Whether the Doctrine, that the King is ſupream head of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> (as the Kings of <hi>Judah,</hi> and the firſt Chriſtian Emperors were of the Jewiſh and Chriſtian Church,) be any new found Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine? Whether it be not true, that Biſhops being made Biſhops, have their Authority immediately from Chriſt, though this or that man be not made Biſhop with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Kings Authority; as well as you ſay, the <hi>Pope</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Pope,</hi> has Authority immediately from Chriſt, and yet this or that man cannot be made <hi>Pope</hi> without the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Cardinals? Whether you do well to ſuppoſe, that Chriſtian Kings have no more Authority in order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the affairs of the Church, than the great <hi>Turk,</hi> or the <hi>Pagan</hi> Emperors? Whether the King may not give Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to a Biſhop to exerciſe his function in ſome part of his Kingdom, and yet not be capable of doing it himſelf: as well as a Biſhop may give Authority to a Phyſician, to practice Phyſick in his Dioceſs, which the Biſhop cannot do himſelf? Whether if <hi>Nero</hi> the Emperor would have commanded S. <hi>Peter</hi> or S. <hi>Paul</hi> to Preach the Goſpel of Chriſt, and to exerciſe the office of a Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> whether they would have queſtioned his Authority to do ſo? Whether there were any Law of God or man, that prohibited K. JAMES to give Commiſſion to Biſhops, nay to lay his injunction upon them, to do any thing that is lawful? Whether a caſual irregularity may not be lawfully diſpenced with? Whether the <hi>Popes</hi> irregularities if he ſhould chance to incur any, be indiſpenſable? And if not, who is he, or who are they, whom the <hi>Pope</hi> is ſo ſubject unto, that they may diſpenſe with him? Whether
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:57896:186"/>that be certain which you take for granted; <hi>That your Ordination imprints a Character and ours doth not?</hi> Whether the power of Conſecrating and Ordaining by impoſition of hands, may not reſide in the Biſhops, and be derived unto them, not from the King but God; and yet the King have Authority to command them to apply this power to ſuch a fit perſon, whom he ſhall commend unto them: As well as if ſome Architects only had the faculty of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitecture,</hi> and had it immediately by infuſion from God himſelf, yet, if they were the Kings Subjects, he wants not authority to command them to build him a Palace for his uſe, or a fortreſs for his ſervice: Or as the King of <hi>France</hi> pretends not to have power to make Prieſts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, yet I hope, you will not deny him power to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand any of his Subjects that has this power, to ordain any fit perſon Prieſt, whom he ſhall deſire to be ordained? Whether it do not follow, that whenſoever the King com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands an Houſe to be Built, a Meſſage to be delivered, or a Murtherer to be Executed, that all theſe things are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently done without intervention of the Architect, Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger, or Executioner: As well as, that they are <hi>ipſo facto</hi> Ordained and Conſecrated, who by the Kings.

Whether many <hi>Popes,</hi> though they were not Conſecrated Biſhops by any temporal Prince, yet might not, or did not receive authority from the Emperor to exerciſe their Epiſcopal function in this or that place? And whether the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors had not authority, upon their deſert, to deprive them of their juriſdiction, by impriſonment or baniſhment? Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Proteſtants do indeed pretend that their Reformation is Univerſal? Whether in ſaying, the <hi>Donatiſts Sect was confined to</hi> Africa, you do not forget your ſelf, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:57896:187"/>what you ſaid above, in §. 17. of this Chapter, where you tell us, <hi>they had ſome of their Sect reſiding in</hi> Rome? Whether it be certain, that none can admit of Biſhops willingly, but thoſe that hold them of Divine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution? Whether they may not be willing to have them, conceiving that way of Government the beſt, though not abſolutely neceſſary? Whether all thoſe <hi>Proteſtants</hi> that conceive the diſtinction between Prieſts and Biſhops, not to be of Divine inſtitution, be Schiſmatical and Hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal for thinking ſo? Whether your form of ordaining Biſhops and Prieſts, be eſſential to the conſtitution of a true Church? Whether the forms of the Church of <hi>England</hi> differ eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially from your forms? Whether in ſaying, that <hi>the true Church cannot ſubſiſt without undoubted true Biſhops and Prieſts,</hi> you have not overthrown the truth of your own Church: wherein I have proved it plainly impoſſible, that any man ſhould be ſo much as morally certain, either of his own Prieſthood or any other mans? Laſtly, whether any one kind of theſe external Forms and Orders, and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be ſo neceſſary to the being of a Church, but that they may not be diverſe in diverſe places, and that a good and peaceable Chriſtian may and ought to ſubmit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the Government of the place where he lives what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever it be? All theſe Queſtions will be neceſſary to be diſcuſſed for the clearing of the truth of the <hi>Minor</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of your former Syllogiſm, and your proofs of it: and I will promiſe to debate them fairly with you, if firſt you will bring ſome better proof of the <hi>Major, That want of Succeſſion is a certain note of Hereſie,</hi> which for the preſent remains both unproved and unprobable.</p>
                     <p n="40">40. <hi>Obj.</hi> You ſay, <hi>The Fathers aſſign Succeſſion as one mark of the true Church.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> I confeſs they did urge Tradition as an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Truth of their Doctrine and of the falſhood of the contrary; and thus far they agree with you. But now ſee the difference: They urged it not againſt all Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks that ever ſhould be, but againſt them who rejected a great part of the Scripture, for no other reaſon but <hi>becauſe it was repugnant to their Doctrine, and corrupted other parts
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:57896:187"/>with their additions and detractions, and perverted the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der with divers abſurd interpretations:</hi> So <hi>Tertullian</hi> not a leaf before the words by you cited. Nay they urged it againſt them who <hi>when they were confuted out of Scripture, fell to accuſe the Scriptures themſelves as if they were not right, and came not from good authority, as if they were various one from another, and as if truth could not be found out of them, by thoſe who know not Tradition, for that it was not delivered in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,</hi> (they did mean wholly,) <hi>but by word of mouth: And that thereupon</hi> Paul <hi>alſo ſaid, we ſpeak wiſdom amongſt the perfect.</hi> So <hi>Irenaeus</hi> in the very next Chapter before that which you alledge. Againſt theſe men being thus neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitated to do ſo, they did urge Tradition, but what or whoſe Tradition was it? Certainly no other but the joynt Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of all the Apoſtolick Churches, with one Mouth and one Voice teaching the ſame Doctrine. Or if for brevity ſake they produce the Tradition of any one Church, yet is it apparent, that that one was then in conjunction with all the reſt; <hi>Irenaeus, Tertullian, Origen,</hi> teſtifie as much in the words cited, and S. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> in the place before alledged by me. This Tradition they did urge againſt theſe men, and in a time, in compariſon of ours, almoſt contiguous to the Apoſtles: So near, that one them, <hi>Irenae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> was Scholar to one who was Scholar to S. <hi>John</hi> the Apoſtle. <hi>Tertullian</hi> and <hi>Origen</hi> were not an Age removed from him: and the laſt of them all, little more than an Age from them. Yet after all this they urged it not as a demonſtration, but only as a very probable argument, far greater than any their Adverſaries could oppoſe againſt it. So <hi>Tertullian</hi> in the place above quoted, §. 5. <hi>How is it like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that ſo many and ſo great Churches ſhould Err in one Faith?</hi> (it ſhould be, ſhould have Erred into one Faith.) And this was the condition of this Argument as the Fathers urged it. Now if you having to deal with us, who queſtion no Book of Scripture, which was not Anciently queſtioned by ſome whom you your ſelves eſteem good Catholicks; nay who refuſe not to be tried by your own Canons, your own. Tranſlations, who in interpreting Scriptures are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to allow of all thoſe rules which you propoſe, only
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:57896:188"/>except that we will not allow you to be our Judges; if you will come fifteen hundred years after the Apoſtles, a fair time for the pureſt Church to gather much droſs and corruptions, and for the <hi>myſtery af iniquity</hi> to bring its work to ſome perfection, which <hi>in the Apoſtles time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to work,</hi> If (I ſay) you will come thus long after and urge us with the ſingle Tradition of one of theſe Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, being now Catholick to it ſelf alone, and Heretical to all the reſt: nay not only with her Ancient Original Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, but alſo with her poſt-nate and introduced Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions, and theſe as we pretend, repugnant to Scripture, and Ancient Tradition, and all this to decline an indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Trial by Scripture, under pretence (wherein alſo you agree with the calumny of the Old Hereticks) that <hi>all neceſſary truth cannot be found in them without recourſe to Tradition:</hi> If, I ſay, notwithſtanding all theſe differences, you will ſtill be urging us with this argument, as the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſame and of the ſame force with that wherewith the fore-mentioned Fathers urged the Old Hereticks, certainly this muſt needs proceed from a confidence you have, not only that we have no School-Divinity, nor Metaphyſicks, but no Logick or common ſenſe, that we are but Pictures of men, and have the definition of rational creatures giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en us in vain.</p>
                     <p n="41">41. But now ſuppoſe I ſhould be liberal to you, and grant what you cannot prove, that the Fathers make Succeſſion a certain and perpetual mark of the true Church; I beſeech you what will come of it? What, that want of Succeſſion is a certain ſign of an Heretical company? Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if you ſay ſo, either you want Logick, which is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſign of an ill diſputer; or are not pleaſed to uſe it, which is a worſe. For ſpeech is a certain ſign of a living man, yet want of ſpeech is no ſure argument that he is dead, for he may be dumb and yet living ſtill, and we may have other evident tokens that he is ſo, as Eating, Drinking, Breathing, Moving: So, though the conſtant and Univerſal delivery of any Doctrine by the Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Churches ever ſince the Apoſtles, be a very great ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of the truth of it, yet there is no certainty, but
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:57896:188"/>that truth, even Divine truth, may through mens wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, be contracted from its univerſality, and interrupted in its perpetuity, and ſo loſe this argument, and yet not want others to juſtifie and ſupport it ſelf. For it may be one of thoſe principles which God hath written in all mens Hearts, or a concluſion evidently ariſing from them: It may be either contained in Scripture in expreſs terms, or deducible from it by apparent conſequence. If therefore you intend to prove want of a perpetual Succeſſion of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors a certain note of Hereſie, you muſt not content your ſelf to ſhew, that having it is one ſign of truth; but you muſt ſhew it to be the only ſign of it and inſeparable from it. But this, if you be well adviſed, you will never un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake. Firſt becauſe it is an impoſſible attempt: and then becauſe if you do it you will marr all: for by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving this an inſeparable ſign of Catholick Doctrine, you will prove your own, which apparently wants it in many points, not to be Catholick. For whereas you ſay <hi>this Succeſſion requires two things, agreement with the Apoſtles Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and an uninterrupted conveyance of it down to them that challenge it:</hi> It will be proved againſt you that you fail in both points; and that ſome things wherein you agree with the Apoſtles have not been held alwaies, as your condemning the Doctrine of the <hi>Chiliaſts,</hi> and holding the Euchariſt not neceſſary for Infants; and that in many other things you agree not with them nor with the Church for many Ages after. For example; In mutilation of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, in having your Service in ſuch a Language as the Aſſiſtants generally underſtand not, your offering to Saints, your Picturing of God, your worſhiping of Pictures.</p>
                     <p n="42">42. Ad §. 24.] Obj. <hi>The true Church muſt have Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſality of place which</hi> Proteſtants <hi>wanting cannot avoid the juſt note of Hereſie.</hi>

                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> You have not ſet down clearly and univocally what you mean by it, whether Univerſality of fact or of right: and if of fact, whether abſolute or compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive: and if comparative, whether of the Church in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of any other Religion, or only of Heretical Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians: or if in compariſon of theſe, whether in compariſon
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:57896:189"/>of all other Sects conjoyned, or in compariſon only of any one of them. Nor have you proved it by any good argument in any ſenſe to be a certain mark of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie: For thoſe places of S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> do not deſerve the name. And truly in my judgment you have done advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly in proving it no better. For as for Univerſality of right, or a right to Univerſality, all Religions claim it, but only the true has it, and which has it cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, unleſs it firſt be determined which is the true. An abſolute Univerſality, and diffuſion through all the World if you ſhould pretend to, all the World would laugh at you. If you ſhould contend for latitude with any one Religion, <hi>Mahumetiſm</hi> would carry the Victory from you. If you ſhould oppoſe your ſelves againſt all other Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians beſides you, it is certain you would be caſt in this ſuit alſo. If laſtly, being hard driven you ſhould pleaſe your ſelves with being more than any one Sect of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, it would preſently be replied, that it is uncertain whether now you are ſo, but moſt certain that the time has been when you have not been ſo.

Upon what certain ground do you know all thoſe things which muſt be known before you can know that your Church is infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible? As that there is a God: that God hath promiſed his aſſiſtance to your Church in all her Decrees: that the Scripture wherein this promiſe is extant is the word of God: that thoſe Texts of Scripture which you alledge for your infallibility are incorrupted: that that which you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend is the true ſenſe of them? When you have produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced certain grounds for all theſe things, I doubt not but it will appear, that we alſo may have grounds certain enough to believe our whole Religion, which is nothing elſe but the Bible, without dependence on the Churches infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. Suppoſe you ſhould meet with a man that for the preſent, believes neither Church, nor Scripture, nor God, but is ready and willing to believe them all, if you can

If you ſay the firſt, you make all Religion an uncertain thing: If the ſecond, then either you muſt ridiculouſly perſwade, that your Church is infallible, becauſe it is infallible, or elſe that there are other certain grounds beſides your Churches infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>

But that which you collect from theſe ſuppoſitions is clearly incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent: and by as good Logick you might conclude, that Logick and Geometry ſtand upon no certain grounds, that the rules of the one, and the principles of the other do ſometimes fail, becauſe the diſagreement of Logici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans and Geometricians ſhew, that ſome of them are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:57896:190"/>Might not a Jew conclude as well againſt all Chriſtians, that they have no certain ground whereon to relie in their underſtanding of Scripture, becauſe their diſagreements ſhew that ſome are deceived; becauſe ſome deduce from it the infallibility of a Church, and others no ſuch matter? So likewiſe a Turk might uſe the ſame ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument againſt both Jews and Chriſtians, and an Atheiſt againſt all Religions, and a Sceptick againſt all reaſon. Might not the one ſay, Mens diſagreement in Religion, ſhews that there is no certainty in any; and the other, that experience of their contradictions teacheth, that the rules of reaſon do ſometimes fail? Do not you ſee and feel how void of reaſon and how full of impiety your ſophiſtry is? And how tranſported with zeal againſt Proteſtants, you urge arguments againſt them, which if they could not be anſwered, would overthrow not only your own, but all Religion? But God be thanked, the anſwer is eaſie and obvious! For let men but remember not to impute the faults of men but only to men, and then it will eaſily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that there may be ſufficient certainty in reaſon, in Religion, in the rules of interpreting Scripture, though men through their faults, take not care to make uſe of them, and ſo run into divers errors and diſſentions.</p>

                     <p>But though we cannot perhaps ſay in particular, thus much, and no more is fundamental, yet believing all the Bible, we are certain enough that we believe all that is fundamental. As he that in a receipt, takes twenty ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients whereof ten only are neceſſary, though he know not which thoſe ten are, yet taking the whole twenty

If obſcurity will not conſiſt with certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the higheſt degree, then you are to blame for requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to faith contradicting conditions. If certainty and obſcurity will ſtand together, what reaſon can be imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that a Proteſtant may not entertain them both as well as a Papiſt? Your bodies and ſouls, your underſtandings and
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:57896:191"/>wills are, I think, of the ſame condition with ours. And why then may not we be certain of an obſcure thing as well as you?</p>
                     <p n="51">51. But then beſides, I am to tell you, that you are here, every where, extreamly, if not affectedly miſtaken in the Doctrin of Proteſtants; who though they acknowledge, that the things which they believe are in themſelves as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain as any demonſtrable or ſenſible verities, yet pretend not that their certainty of adherence is moſt perfect and abſolute, but ſuch as may be perfected and increaſed as long as they <hi>walk by faith and not by ſight.</hi> And conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant hereunto is their doctrin touching the evidence of the objects whereunto they adhere. For you abuſe the world and them, if you pretend that they hold the firſt of your two principles, That theſe particular Books are the word of God, (for ſo I think you mean) either to be in it ſelf evidently certain, or of it ſelf and being deveſted of the motives of credibility, evidently credible: For they are not ſo fond as to be ignorant, nor ſo vain as to pretend, that all men do aſſent to it, which they would if it were evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently certain, nor ſo ridiculous as to imagine, that if an <hi>Indian</hi> that never heard of Chriſt or Scripture, ſhould by chance find a Bible in his own Language, and were able to read it, that upon the reading it he would certainly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a miracle believe it to be the word of God: which he could not chuſe if it were evidently credible. What then do they affirm of it? Certainly no more than this, that whatſoever man that is not of a perverſe mind, ſhall weigh with ſerious and mature deliberation, thoſe great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of reaſon which may incline him to believe the Divine authority of Scripture, and compare them with the light objections that in prudence can be made againſt it, he ſhall not chuſe but find ſufficient nay abundant induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to yield unto it firm faith and ſincere obedience. Let that learned man <hi>Hugo Grotius</hi> ſpeak for all the reſt, in his Book <hi>of the Truth of Chriſtian Religion;</hi> which Book whoſoever attentively peruſes ſhall find that a man may have great reaſon to be a Chriſtian without dependence upon your Church for any part of it: and that your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:57896:192"/>is no foundation of, but rather a ſcandal and an objection againſt Chriſtianity. He then in the laſt Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of his ſecond Book hath theſe excellent words, <q>If any be not ſatisfied with theſe arguments aboveſaid, but deſires more forcible reaſons for confirmation of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of Chriſtian Religion, let ſuch know that as there are variety of things which be true, ſo are there di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ways of proving or manifeſting the truth. Thus is there one way in Mathematicks, another in Phyſicks, a third in Ethicks, and laſtly another kind when a matter of fact is in queſtion: wherein verily we muſt reſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with ſuch Teſtimonies as are free from all ſuſpicion of untruth; otherwiſe down goes all the frame and uſe of Hiſtory, and a great part of the art of Phyſick, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with all dutifulneſs that ought to be between parents and children: for matters of practice can no way elſe be known but by ſuch Teſtimonies. Now it is the pleaſure of Almighty God that thoſe things which he would have us to believe (ſo that the very belief thereof may be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to us for obedience) ſhould not ſo evidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, as thoſe things which are apprehended by ſenſe and plain demonſtration, but only be ſo far forth reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as may beget faith, and a perſwaſion thereof, in the hearts and minds of ſuch as are not obſtinate: That ſo the Goſpel may be as a touchſtone for tryal of mens judgments, whether they be ſound or unſound. For ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe arguments, whereof we have ſpoken, have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced ſo many honeſt, godly, and wiſe men to approve of this Religion, it is thereby plain enough that the fault of other mens infidelity is not for want of ſufficient teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, but becauſe they would not have that to be had and embraced for truth which is contrary to their wilful deſires; it being a hard matter for them to relinquiſh their honours, and ſet at naught other commodities; which thing they know they ought to do, if they admit of Chriſts Doctrin and obey what he hath commanded. And this is the rather to be noted of them, for that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other hiſtorical narrations are approved by them to be true, which notwithſtanding are only manifeſt by autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:57896:192"/>and not by any ſuch ſtrong proofs, and perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or tokens, as do declare the hiſtory of Chriſt to be true; which are evident, partly by the confeſſion of thoſe Jews that are yet alive; and partly in thoſe compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies and congregations of Chriſtians which are any where to be found; whereof doubtleſs there was ſome cauſe. Laſtly, ſeeing the long duration or continuance of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion, and the large extent thereof can be aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to no human power, therefore the ſame muſt be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to miracles: or if any deny that it came to paſs through a miraculous manner; this very getting ſo great ſtrength and power without a miracle, may be thought to ſurpaſs any miracle.</q>

                     <p n="52">52. And now you ſee I hope that Proteſtants neither do nor need to pretend to any ſuch evidence in the doctrin they believe, as cannot well conſiſt both with the eſſence and the obedience of faith. Let us come now to the laſt nullity which you impute to the faith of Proteſtants, and that it is <hi>want of prudence.</hi> Touching which point, as I have already demonſtrated, that wiſdom is not eſſential to faith, but that a man may truly believe truth, though upon inſufficient motives; So I doubt not but I ſhall make good, that if prudence were neceſſary to faith, we have better title to it than you; and that if a wiſer than <hi>Solomon</hi> were here, he ſhould have better reaſon to believe the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of Proteſtants than Papiſts, the Bible rather than the Council of <hi>Trent.</hi> But let us hear what you can ſay!</p>
                     <p n="53">53. Ad §. 31. You demand then firſt of all, <hi>What wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom was it to forſake a Church confeſſedly very ancient, and beſides which there could be demonſtrated no other Viſible Church of Chriſt upon earth?</hi> I anſwer: Againſt God and truth there lies no preſcription, and therefore certainly it might be great wiſdom to forſake ancient Errors for more anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Truths. One God is rather to be followed than innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable worlds of men: And therefore it might be great wiſdom either for the whole Viſible Church, nay for all the men in the world, having wandred from the way of Truth, to return unto it; or for a part of it, nay for one man to do ſo, although all the world beſides were madly
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:57896:193"/>reſolute to do the contrary. It might be great wiſdom to forſake the Errors though of the only Viſible Church, much more the <hi>Roman,</hi> which in conceiving her ſelf the whole Viſible Church, does ſomewhat like the Frog in the Fable, which thought the Ditch he lived in to be all the World.</p>
                     <p n="54">54. You demand again, <hi>What wiſdom was it to forſake a Church acknowledged to want nothing neceſſary to Salvation, indued with Succeſſion of Biſhops,</hi> &amp;c. uſ<expan>
                           <am>
                              <g ref="char:abque"/>

                           <ex>que</ex>
                        </expan> ad <hi>Election or Choice?</hi> I anſwer: Yet might it be great wiſdom to forſake a Church not acknowledged to want nothing neceſſary to Salvation, but accuſed and convicted of many damnable errors: certainly damnable to them who were convicted of them, had they ſtill perſiſted in them after their convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; though perhaps pardonable (which is all that is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged) to ſuch as ignorantly continued in them. A Church vainly arrogating without poſſibility of proof a perpetual Succeſſion of Biſhops, holding always the ſame doctrine; and with a ridiculous impudence pretending per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual poſſeſſion of all the world: whereas the world knows, that a little before <hi>Luthers</hi> ariſing, your Church was confined to a part of a part of it. Laſtly a Church vainly glorying in the dependence of other Churches upon her, which yet ſhe ſupports no more than thoſe crouching Anticks which ſeem in great buildings to labour under the weight they bear, do indeed ſupport the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick. For a corrupted and falſe Church may give autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to preach the Truth, and conſequently againſt her own falſhoods and corruptions. Beſides, a falſe Church may preſerve the Scripture true, (as now the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is preſerved by the Jews,) either not being arrived to that height of impiety as to attempt the corruption of it, or not able to effect it, or not perceiving, or not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding the oppoſition of it to her corruptions. And ſo we might receive from you lawful Ordination and true Scriptures, though you were a falſe Church; and receiving the Scriptures from you (though not from you alone, I hope you cannot hinder us, neither need we ask your leave to believe and obey them. And this, though you be a falſe
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:57896:193"/>Church; and receiving the Scriptures from you (though not from you alone,) I hope you cannot hinder us, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther need we ask your leave, to believe and obey them. And this, though you be a falſe Church, is enough to make us a true one. As for a <hi>Succeſſion of men that held with us in all points of Doctrine,</hi> it is a thing we need not, and you have as little as we. So that if we acknowledge that your Church before <hi>Luther</hi> was a true Church, it is not for any ends, for any dependence that we have up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you; but becauſe we conceive that in a charitable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, you may paſs for a true Church. Such a Church (and no better) as you do ſometimes acknowledge <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants</hi> to be, that is, a Company of men, wherein ſome ignorant Souls may be ſaved. So that in this ballancing of Religion againſt Religion, and Church againſt Church, it ſeems you have nothing of weight and moment to put into your Scale; nothing but Smoak and Wind, vain ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows and phantaſtical pretences. Yet if <hi>Proteſtants</hi> on the other ſide, had nothing to put in their Seal but thoſe negative commendations which you are pleaſed to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford them; nothing but, no Unity, nor means to procure it; no farther extent when <hi>Luther</hi> aroſe than <hi>Luthers</hi> Body; no Univerſality of time or place; no viſibility or being, except only in your Church; no Succeſſion of Perſons or Doctrine; no leader but <hi>Luther,</hi> in a quarrel begun upon no ground but paſſion; no Church, no Ordination, no Scriptures but ſuch as they received from you; if all this were true, and this were all that could be pleaded for Proteſtants, poſſibly with an allowance of three grains of partiality your Scale might ſeem to turn. But then if it may appear that part of theſe objections are falſly made againſt them, the reſt vainly; that whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever of truth is in theſe imputations, is impertinent to this Tryal, and whatſoever is pertinent is untrue; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, that plenty of good matter may be alledged for Proteſtants which is here diſſembled: then I hope, our Cauſe may be good notwithſtanding theſe pretences.</p>
                     <p n="55">55. I ſay then, that want of Univerſality of time and place, The inviſibility or not exiſtence of the profeſſors of
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:57896:194"/>Proteſtant Doctrine before <hi>Luther, Luthers</hi> being alone when he firſt oppoſed your Church, Our having our Church, Ordinations, Scriptures, perſonal and yet not Doctrinal Succeſſion from you, are vain and impertinent allegations, againſt the truth of our Doctrine and Church. That the entire truth of Chriſt without any mixture of Error ſhould be profeſſed or believed in all places at any time, or in any place at all times, is not a thing evident in reaſon, neither have we any Revelation for it. And therefore in relying ſo confidently on it, you build your Houſe upon the Sand. And what obligation we had ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be ſo peeviſh, as to take nothing of yours, or ſo fooliſh as to take all, I do not underſtand. For whereas you ſay that <hi>this is to be chooſers and therefore Hereticks,</hi> I tell you that though all Hereticks are chooſers, yet all chooſers are not Hereticks, otherwiſe they alſo, which chooſe your Religion muſt be Hereticks. As for <hi>our want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Unity and Means of proving it,</hi> Luthers <hi>oppoſing your Church upon meer paſſion, our following private men rather than the Catholick Church;</hi> the firſt and laſt are meer untruths, for we want not Unity, nor means to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure it in things neceſſary. Plain places of Scripture, and ſuch as need no interpreter are our means to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it. Neither do we follow any private men, but only the Scripture, the Word of God as our rule, and reaſon, which is alſo the gift of God given to direct us in all our actions, in the uſe of this rule. And then for <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers oppoſing your Church upon meer paſſion,</hi> it is a thing I will not deny becauſe I know not his Heart, and for the ſame reaſon you ſhould not have affirmed it. Sure I am, whether he oppoſed your Church upon reaſon or no, he had reaſon enough to oppoſe it. And therefore if he did it upon paſſion, we will follow him only in his action and not in his paſſion, in his oppoſition, not in the manner of it; and then I preſume you will have no reaſon to condemn us, unleſs you will ſay that a good action cannot be done with reaſon, becauſe ſome Body before us hath done it upon paſſion. You ſee then how imprudent you have been in the choice of your arguments,
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:57896:194" rendition="simple:additions"/>to prove <hi>Proteſtants</hi> unwiſe in the choice of their Religion.</p>
                     <p n="56">56. It remains now, that I ſhould ſhew that many rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of moment may be alledged for the juſtification of <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> which are diſſembled by you, and not put into the Balance. Know then, Sir, that when I ſay, the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> is in prudence to be preferred before yours: as on the one ſide I do not underſtand by your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, the Doctrine of <hi>Bellarmine</hi> or <hi>Baronius,</hi> or any other private man amongſt you, nor the Doctrine of the <hi>Sorbon,</hi> or of the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> or of the <hi>Dominicans,</hi> or of any other particular Company among you, but that wherein you all agree, or profeſs to agree, <hi>the Doctrine of the Council of Trent:</hi> ſo accordingly on the other ſide, by the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of Proteſtants,</hi> I do not underſtand the Doctrine of <hi>Luther</hi> or <hi>Calvin,</hi> or <hi>Melancthon;</hi> nor the Confeſſion of <hi>Auguſta,</hi> or <hi>Geneva,</hi> nor the Catechiſm of <hi>Heidelburg,</hi> nor the Articles of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> no nor the <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi> of <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Confeſſions; but that wherein they all agree, and which they all ſubſcribe with a greater <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,</hi> as a perfect rule of their Faith and Actions, that is, The <hi>Bible.</hi> The <hi>Bible,</hi> I ſay, The <hi>Bible</hi> only is the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of <hi>Proteſtants!</hi> Whatſoever elſe they believe beſides it, and the plain, irrefragable, indubitable conſequences of it, well may they hold it as a matter of Opinion; but as matter of Faith and Religion, neither can they with co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence to their own grounds believe it themſelves, nor require the belief of it of others, without moſt high and moſt Schiſmatical preſumption. I for my part after a long (and as I verily believe and hope,) impartial ſearch of <hi>the true way to Eternal Happineſs,</hi> do profeſs plainly that I cannot find any reſt for the ſole of my Foot, but upon this Rock only. I ſee plainly and with mine own eyes, that there are <hi>Popes</hi> againſt <hi>Popes,</hi> Councils againſt Councils, ſome Fathers againſt others, the ſame Fathers againſt themſelves, a Conſent of Fathers of one Age againſt a Conſent of Fathers of another Age, the Church of one Age againſt the Church of another Age. Traditive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations of Scripture are pretended, but there are few or none to be found: No Tradition but only of
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:57896:195" rendition="simple:additions"/>Scripture, can derive it ſelf from the Fountain, but may be plainly proved, either to have been brought in, in ſuch an Age after Chriſt; or that in ſuch an Age it was not in. In a word, there is no ſufficient certainty but of Scripture only, for any conſidering man to build up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. This therefore, and this only I have reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve: This I will profeſs, according to this I will live, and for this, if there be occaſion, I will not only willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but even gladly loſe my life, though I ſhould be ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that Chriſtians ſhould take it from me. Propoſe me any thing out of this Book, and require whether I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it or no, and ſeem it never ſo incomprehenſible to humane reaſon, I will ſubſcribe it with Hand and Heart, as knowing no demonſtration can be ſtronger than this, God hath ſaid ſo; therefore, it is true. In other things I will take no mans liberty of judgment from him; neither ſhall any man take mine from me. I will think no man the worſe man, nor the worſe Chriſtian: I will love no man the leſs, for differing in opinion from me. And what meaſure I mete to others I expect from them again. I am fully aſſured that God does not, and therefore that men ought not to require any more of any man than this, To believe the Scripture to be Gods word, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to find the true ſenſe of it, and to live according to it.</p>
                     <p n="57">57. This is the Religion which I have choſen after a long deliberation, and I am verily perſuaded that I have choſen wiſely, much more wiſely than if I had guided my ſelf according to your Churches authority. For the Scripture being all true, I am ſecured by believing nothing elſe, that I ſhall believe no falſhood as matter of Faith. And if I miſtake the ſenſe of Scripture, and ſo fall into Error, yet am I ſecure from any danger thereby, if but your grounds be true: becauſe endeavouring to find the true ſenſe of Scripture, I cannot but hold my Error with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out pertinacy, and be ready to forſake it when a more true and a more probable ſenſe ſhall appear unto me. And then all neceſſary truth being as I have proved, plainly ſet down in Scripture, I am certain by believing Scripture, to believe
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:57896:195"/>all neceſſary Truth: And he that does ſo, if his life be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to his Faith, how is it poſſible he ſhould fail of Salvation?</p>
                     <p n="58">58. Beſides, whatſoever may be pretended to gain to your Church the credit of a Guide, all that and much more may be ſaid for the Scripture. Hath your Church been Ancient? The Scripture is more Ancient. Is your Church a means to keep men at Unity? So is the Scripture to keep thoſe that believe it and will obey it, in Unity of belief, in matters neceſſary or very profitable, and in Unity of Charity in points unneceſſary. Is your Church Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal for time or place? Certainly the Scripture is more U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal. For all the Chriſtians in the World (thoſe I mean that in truth deſerve this name,) do now, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways have believed the Scripture to be the Word of God: whereas only you ſay that you only are the Church of God, and all Chriſtians beſides you deny it.</p>
                     <p n="59">59. Thirdly, following the Scripture, I follow that whereby you prove your Churches infallibility, (whereof were it not for Scripture what pretence could you have, or what notion could we have?) and by ſo doing tacitely confeſs, that your ſelves are ſurer of the Truth of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture than of your Churches authority. For we muſt be ſurer of the proof than of the thing proved, otherwiſe it is no proof.</p>
                     <p n="60">60. Fourthly, following the Scripture, I follow that which muſt be true if your Church be true: for your Church gives atteſtation to it. Whereas if I follow your Church, I muſt follow that which, though Scripture be true, may be falſe; nay which if Scripture be true muſt be falſe, becauſe the Scripture teſtifies againſt it.</p>
                     <p n="61">61. Fifthly, to follow the Scripture I have Gods expreſs warrant and command, and no colour of any prohibition: But to believe your Church infallible, I have no command at all, much leſs an expreſs command. Nay I have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to fear that I am prohibited to do ſo in theſe Words: <hi>call no man Maſter on Earth: They fell by infidelity, Thou ſtandeſt by Faith, Be not high minded but fear: The Spirit of truth The World cannot receive.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="382" facs="tcp:57896:196"/>
                     <p n="62">62. Following your Church I muſt hold many things not only above reaſon but againſt it, if any thing be againſt it: whereas following the Scripture I ſhall believe many myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries but no impoſſibilities; many things above reaſon, but nothing againſt it; many things which had they not been revealed, reaſon could never have diſcovered, but nothing which by true reaſon may be confuted: many things which reaſon cannot comprehend how they can be, but nothing which reaſon can comprehend that it cannot be. Nay I ſhall believe nothing which reaſon will not convince that I ought to believe it: For reaſon will convince any man, unleſs he be of a perverſe mind, that the Scripture is the Word of God: And then no reaſon can be greater than this, God ſays ſo, therefore it is true.</p>
                     <p n="63">63. Following your Church I muſt hold many things which to any mans judgment that will give himſelf the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of judgment, will ſeem much more plainly contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by Scripture, than the infallibility of your Church ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to be confirmed by it; and conſequently muſt be ſo fooliſh as to believe your Church exempted from Error up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on leſs evidence, rather than ſubject to the common condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mankind upon greater evidence. Now if I take the Scripture only for my Guide, I ſhall not need to do any thing ſo unreaſonable.</p>
                     <p n="64">64. If I will follow your Church I muſt believe impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities, and that with an abſolute certainty, upon motives which are confeſſed to be but only <hi>Prudential</hi> and probable: That is, with a weak Foundation I muſt firmly ſupport a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, a monſtrous heavy building: Now following the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture I ſhall have no neceſſity to undergo any ſuch difficulties.</p>
                     <p n="65">65. Following your Church I muſt be ſervant of Chriſt and a Subject of the King, but only <hi>Ad placitum Papae.</hi> I muſt be prepared in mind to renounce my allegiance to the King, when the <hi>Pope</hi> ſhall declare him an Heretick and command me not to obey him: And I muſt be prepared in mind <hi>to eſteem Vertue Vice, and Vice Vertue, if the</hi> Pope <hi>ſhall ſo determine.</hi> Indeed you ſay it is impoſſible he ſhould do the latter; but that you know is a great queſtion, neither is it fit my obedience to God and the King ſhould depend
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:57896:196"/>upon a queſtionable Foundation. And howſoever, you muſt grant that if by an impoſſible ſuppoſition the <hi>Popes</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands ſhould be contrary to the law of Chriſt, that they of your Religion muſt reſolve to obey rather the commands of the <hi>Pope</hi> than the law of Chriſt. Whereas if I follow the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, I may, nay I muſt obey my Sovereign in lawful things, though an Heretick, though a Tyrant, and though, I do not ſay the <hi>Pope,</hi> but the Apoſtles themſelves, nay <hi>an Angel from Heaven ſhould teach any thing againſt the Goſpel of Chriſt, I may, nay I muſt denounce Anathema to him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="66">66. Following the Scripture I ſhall believe a Religion, which being contrary to Fleſh and Blood, without any aſſiſtance from worldly power, wit or policy; nay againſt all the power and policy of the World prevailed and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged it ſelf in a very ſhort time all the World over. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it is too too apparent, that your Church hath got and ſtill maintains her authority over mens Conſciences, by counterfeiting falſe miracles, forging falſe ſtories, by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truding on the World ſuppoſitious writings, by corrupting the monuments of former times, and defacing out of them all which any way makes againſt you, by Wars, by perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, by Maſſacres, by Treaſons, by Rebellions; in ſhort, by all manner of Carnal means whether violent or fraudu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent.</p>
                     <p n="67">67. Following the Scripture I ſhall believe a Religion, the firſt Preachers of Profeſſors whereof, it is moſt certain they could have no worldly ends upon the World, that they could not project to themſelves by it any of the profits or honours or pleaſures of this World, but rather were to expect the contrary, even all the miſeries which the World could lay upon them. On the other ſide, the Head of your Church, the pretended Succeſſor of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and Guide of Faith, it is even palpable, that he makes your Religion the inſtrument of his ambition, and by it ſeeks to entitle himſelf <hi>directly or indirectly to the Monarchy of the World.</hi> And beſides, it is evident to any man that has but half an eye, that moſt of thoſe Doctrines which you add to the Scripture do make one way or other, for the honour or temporal profit of the Teachers of them.</p>
                     <pb n="384" facs="tcp:57896:197"/>
                     <p n="68">68. Following the Scripture only, I ſhall embrace a Religion of admirable ſimplicity, conſiſting in a manner wholly in the worſhip of God in Spirit and Truth. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as your Church and Doctrine is even loaded with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity of weak, childiſh, ridiculous, unſavoury ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and ceremonies, and full of that <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> for which <hi>Chriſt ſhall Judge the World.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="69">69. Following the Scripture, I ſhall believe that which Univerſal, never-failing Tradition aſſures me, that it was by the admirable ſupernatural Work of God confirmed to be the Word of God: whereas never any miracle was wrought, never ſo much as a lame Horſe cured in confirmation of your Churches authority and infallibility. And if any ſtrange things have been done, which may ſeem to give atteſtation to ſome parts of your Doctrine, yet this proves nothing but the truth of the Scripture, which foretold that (Gods providence permitting it, and the wickedneſs of the World deſerving it) <hi>ſtrange ſigns and wonders ſhould be wrought to confirm falſe Doctrine, that they which love not the Truth, may be given over to ſtrange deluſions.</hi> Neither does it ſeem to me any ſtrange thing, that God ſhould permit ſome true wonders to be done to delude them who have forged ſo many to deceive the World.</p>
                     <p n="70">70. If I follow the Scripture, I muſt not promiſe my ſelf Salvation without effectual dereliction and mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of all Vices, and the effectual Practice of all Chriſtian Vertues: But your Church opens an eaſier and a broader way to Heaven, and though I continue all my life long in a courſe of ſin, and without the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of any Vertue, yet gives me aſſurance that I may be let into Heaven, at a Poſtern-gate, even by any Act of Attrition at the hour of Death, if it be joyned with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, or by an Act of Contrition without confeſſion.</p>
                     <p n="71">71. Admirable are the Precepts of piety and humility, of innocence and patience, of liberality, frugality, temper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, ſobriety, juſtice, meekneſs, fortitude, conſtancy and gravity, contempt of the World, love of God and the love of mankind; In a Word, of all Vertues, and
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:57896:197"/>againſt all vice, which the Scriptures impoſe upon us, to be obeyed under pain of damnation: The ſum whereof is in manner compriſed in our <hi>Saviours Sermon upon the Mount,</hi> recorded in the 5, 6, and 7. of S. <hi>Matthew,</hi> which if they were generally obeyed, could not but make the world generally happy, and the goodneſs of them alone were ſufficient to make any wiſe and good man believe that this Religion rather than any other, came from God the fountain of all goodneſs. And that they may be generally obeyed, our Saviour hath ratified them all in the cloſe of his Sermon, with theſe univerſal Sanctions, <hi>Not every one that ſaith Lord Lord, ſhall enter into the Kingdom, but he that doth the will of my Father which is in Heaven:</hi> and again, <hi>whoſoever heareth theſe ſayings of mine and doth them not, ſhall be likned unto a fooliſh man which built his houſe upon the ſand, and the rain deſcended, and the flood came, and the winds blew, and it fell, and great was the fall thereof.</hi> Now your Church, notwithſtanding all this, enervates and in a manner diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves and abrogates many of theſe precepts, teaching men that they are not Laws for all Chriſtians, but Counſels of perfection and matters of Supererrogation: that a man ſhall do well if he do obſerve them, but he ſhall not ſin if he obſerve them not; that they are for them who aim at high places in heaven, who aſpire with the two ſons of <hi>Zebede,</hi> to the right hand or to the left hand of Chriſt: But if a man will be content barely to go to heaven, and to be a door<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper in the houſe of God, eſpecially if he will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to taſt of Purgatory in the way, he may obtain it at any eaſier purchaſe. Therefore the Religion of your Church is not ſo holy nor ſo good as the doctrin of Chriſt delivered in Scripture, and therefore not ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to come from the Fountain of holineſs and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                     <p n="72">72. Laſtly, if I follow your Church for my Guide, I ſhall do all one, as if I ſhould follow a Company of blind men in a judgment of colours, or in the choice of a way. For every unconſidering man is blind in that which he does not conſider. Now what is your Church but a Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of unconſidering men, who comfort themſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:57896:198"/>they are a great company together, but all of them, either out of idleneſs refuſe the trouble of a ſevere tryal of their Religion, (as if heaven were not worth it,) or out of ſuperſtition fear the event of ſuch a tryal, that they may be ſcrupled and ſtaggered and diſquieted by it; and therefore, for the moſt part do it not all. Or if they do it, they do it negligently and hypocritically, and perfunctorily, rather for the ſatisfaction of others than themſelves: but certainly without indifference, without liberty of judgment, without a reſolution to doubt of it, if upon examination the grounds of it prove uncertain, or to leave it, if they prove apparently falſe. My own experience aſſures me, that in this imputation I do you no injury: but it is very apparent to all men from your ranking, <hi>doubting of any part of your Doctrin,</hi> among mortal ſins. For from hence it follows, that ſeeing every man muſt reſolve that he will never commit mortal ſin, that he muſt never examine the grounds of it at all, for fear he ſhould be moved to doubt: or if he do, he muſt reſolve that no motives, be they never ſo ſtrong ſhall move him to doubt, but that with his will and reſolution he will uphold himſelf in a firm belief of your Religion, though his reaſon and his underſtanding fail him. And ſeeing this is the condition of all thoſe whom you eſteem good Catholicks, who can deny, but you are a Company of men unwilling and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid to underſtand, leſt you ſhould do good! That have eyes to ſee and will not ſee, that have <hi>not the love of truth</hi> (which is only to be known by an indifferent tryal,) and therefore deſerve <hi>to be given over to ſtrong deluſions;</hi> men that love darkneſs more than light: in a word, that you are <hi>the blind leading the blind,</hi> and what prudence there can be, in following ſuch Guides, our Saviour hath taught us in ſaying, <hi>If the blind lead the blind, both ſhall fall into the ditch.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="74">74. Ad §. 32. Your next and laſt argument againſt the faith of Proteſtants is, becauſe <hi>wanting certainty and prudence, it muſt alſo want the fourth condition, Supernaturality. For that being a humane perſwaſion, it is not in the eſſence of it Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural: and being imprudent and raſh, it cannot proceed
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:57896:198"/>from Divine motion, and ſo is not ſupernatural in reſpect of the cauſe from which it proceedeth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> This little diſcourſe ſtands wholly upon what went before, and therefore muſt fall together with it. I have proved the Faith of Proteſtants as certain, and as prudent as the faith of Papiſts; and therefore if theſe be certain grounds of ſupernaturality, our faith may have it as well as yours. I would here furthermore be informed how you can aſſure us that your faith is not your perſwaſion or opinion (for you make them all one,) that your Churches doctrine is true? Or if you grant it your perſwaſion, why is it not the perſwaſion of men, and in reſpect of the ſubject of it, an humane perſwaſion? I deſire alſo to know, what ſenſe there is in pretending that your perſwaſion is, not in regard of the object only and cauſe of it, but in nature or eſſence of it ſupernatural? Laſtly, whereas you ſay, that <hi>being imprudent it cannot come from divine motion:</hi> cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly by this reaſon all they that believe your own Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and cannot give a wiſe and ſufficient reaſon for it, (as millions amongſt you cannot) muſt be condemned to have no ſupernatural faith: or if not, then without queſtion nothing can hinder, but that the imprudent faith of Proteſtants may proceed from divine motion, as well as the imprudent faith of Papiſts.</p>
                     <p n="75">75. And thus having weighed your whole diſcourſe, and found it altogether lighter than vanity, why ſhould I not invert your concluſion, and ſay, Seeing you have not proved that whoſoever errs againſt any one point of Faith loſeth all divine Faith: nor that any error whatſoever concerning that which by the Parties litigant may be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed a matter of faith is a grievous ſin, it follows not at all, that when two men hold different doctrines con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Religion, that but one can be ſaved? Not that I deny, but that the ſentence of S. <hi>Chryſoſt.</hi> with which you conclude this Chapter may in a good ſenſe be true: for oftimes by <hi>the faith</hi> is meant only that Doctrin which is <hi>neceſſary to ſalvation,</hi> and to ſay that ſalvation may be had without any the leaſt thing which is neceſſary to ſalvation, implies a repugnance and deſtroys it ſelf. Beſides, not to
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:57896:199"/>believe all neceſſary points, and to believe none at all, is for the purpoſe of ſalvation all one; and therefore he that does ſo, may juſtly be ſaid to deſtroy the Goſpel of Chriſt, ſeeing he makes it uneffectual to the end for which it was intended, the Salvation of mens ſouls. But why you ſhould conceive that all differences about Religion are concerning matters of faith, in this high notion of the word, for that I conceive no reaſon.</p>

Ad §. 2.] WHereas you ſay, <hi>it is directly againſt Charity to our ſelves, to adventure the omitting of any means neceſſary to ſalvation,</hi> this is true: But ſo is this alſo, that it is directly againſt the ſame Charity, to adventure the omitting any thing, that may any way help or conduce to my ſalvation, that may make the way to it more ſecure or leſs dangerous. And therefore if the errors of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church do but hinder me in this way, or any way endanger it, I am in Charity to my ſelf bound to forſake them, though they be not deſtructive of it. Again, whereas you conclude, <hi>That if by living out of the</hi> Roman <hi>Church we put our ſelves in hazard to want ſomething neceſſary to Salvation, we commit a grievous ſin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the vertue of Charity as it reſpects our ſelves:</hi> This con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence may be good in thoſe which are thus perſwaded of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and yet live out of it. But the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition is certainly falſe. We may live and die out of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, without putting our ſelves in any ſuch hazard: Nay to live and die in it is as dangerous as to ſhoot a gulf, which though ſome good ignorant ſouls may do
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:57896:199"/>and eſcape, yet it may well be feared that not one in a hundred but miſcarries.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. <hi>Ad</hi> §. 5.] In this Section I obſerve, firſt, this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of yours, <hi>That in things neceſſary only becauſe commanded, a probableignorance of the commandment excuſes the party from all fault, and doth not exclude Salvation.</hi> From which Doctrin it ſeems to me to follow, that ſeeing obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the <hi>Roman</hi> Church cannot be pretended to be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, but only becauſe it is commanded, therefore not only an invincible, but even a probable ignorance of this preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded command, muſt excuſe us from all faulty breach of it, and cannot exclude Salvation. Now ſeeing this command is not pretended to be expreſly delivered, but only to be deduced from the word of God, and that not by the moſt clear and evident conſequences that may be; and ſeeing an infinity of great objections lies againſt it, which ſeem ſtrongly to prove that there is no ſuch command; with what Charity can you ſuppoſe that our ignorance of this comand, is not at the leaſt probable, if not all things conſider'd, plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly invincible? Sure I am, for my part, that I have done my true endeavour to find it true, and am ſtill willing to do ſo; but the more I ſeek, the farther I am from finding, and therefore if it be true, certainly my not finding it is very excuſable, and you have reaſon to be very charitable in your cenſures of me. 2. Whereas you ſay, That <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides theſe things neceſſary becauſe commanded, there are other things, which are commanded becauſe neceſſary: of which number you make Divine infallible faith, Baptiſm in Act for Children, and in deſire for thoſe who are come to the uſe of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and the Sacrament of Confeſſion, for thoſe who have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted mortal ſin:</hi> In theſe words you ſeem to me to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a ſtrange Paradox, <hi>viz.</hi> That Faith, and Baptiſm, and Confeſſion are not therefore neceſſary for us, becauſe God appointed them, but are therefore appointed by God becauſe they were neceſſary for us, antecedently to his appointment; which if it were true, I wonder what it was beſide God that made them neceſſary, and made it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for God to command them! Beſides, in making faith one of theſe neceſſary means, you ſeem to exclude Infants
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:57896:200"/>from Salvation: For <hi>Faith comes by hearing,</hi> and they have not heard. In requiring that this Faith ſhould be <hi>divine and infallible,</hi> you caſt your <hi>Credentes</hi> into infinite perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, who cannot poſſibly by any ſure mark diſcern whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their Faith be Divine or human, or if you have any certain ſign, whereby they may diſcern, whether they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve your Churches infallibility with Divine or only with humane faith, I pray produce it, for perhaps it may ſerve us to ſhew, that our Faith is Divine as well as yours. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over in affirming that <hi>Baptiſm in act is neceſſary for Infants, and for men only in deſire,</hi> You ſeem to me in the latter to deſtroy the foundation of the former. For if a deſire of Baptiſm will ſerve men in ſtead of Baptiſm, then thoſe words of our Saviour, <hi>Unleſs a man be born again of water,</hi> &amp;c. are not to be underſtood literally and rigidly of exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Baptiſm; for a deſire of Baptiſm is not Baptiſm, and ſo your foundation of the abſolute neceſſity of Baptiſm is deſtroyed. And if you may gloſs the Text ſo far, as that men may be ſaved by the deſire, without Baptiſm it ſelf, becauſe they cannot have it, why ſhould you not gloſs it a little farther, that there may be ſome hope of the ſalvation of unbaptized infants: to whom it was more impoſſible to have a deſire of Baptiſm, than for the former to have the thing it ſelf? Laſtly, for your <hi>Sacrament of Confeſſion,</hi> we know none ſuch, nor any ſuch abſolute neceſſity of it. They that confeſs their ſins and forſake them ſhall find mercy, though they confeſs them to God only and not to men. They that confeſs them both to God and men, if they do not effectually and in time forſake them, ſhall not find mercy. 3. Whereas you ſay, that <hi>ſuppoſing theſe means once appointed as abſolutely neceſſary to ſalvation, there cannot but ariſe an obligation of procuring to have them,</hi> you muſt ſuppoſe I hope, that we know them to be ſo appointed, and that it is in our power to procure them: otherwiſe though it may be our ill fortune to fail of the end, for want of the means, certainly we cannot be obliged to procure them. For the rule of the law is alſo the dictate of common reaſon and equity, That <hi>no man can be obliged to what is impoſſible.</hi> We can be obliged to nothing but
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:57896:200"/>by vertue of ſome command: now it is impoſſible that God ſhould command in earneſt any thing which he knows to be impoſſible. For to command in earneſt, is to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand with an intent to be obeyed; which is not poſſible he ſhould do, when he knows the thing commanded to be impoſſible. Laſtly, whoſoever is obliged to do any thing, and does it not, commits a fault; but Infants com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit no fault in not procuring to have Baptiſm, therefore no obligation lies upon them to procure it. 4. Whereas you ſay, that <hi>if Proteſtants diſſent from you in the point of the neceſſity of Baptiſm for Infants, it cannot be denied but that our diſagreement is in a point fundamental;</hi> If you mean a point eſteemed ſo by you, this indeed cannot be denied: But if you mean a point that indeed is fundamental, this may certainly be denied, for I deny it, and ſay, that it doth not appear to me any way neceſſary to Salvation to hold the truth, or not to hold an error, touching the condition of theſe Infants. This is certain, and we muſt believe that God will not deal unjuſtly with them, but how in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar he will deal with them concerns not us, and therefore we need not much regard it. 5. Whereas you ſay the like of your <hi>Sacrament of Pennance,</hi> you only ſay ſo, but your proofs are wanting. Laſtly, whereas you ſay, <hi>This rigour ought not to ſeem ſtrange or unjuſt in God, but that we are rather to bleſs him for ordaining us to Salvation by any means:</hi> I anſwer, that it is true, we are not to queſtion the known will of God of injuſtice; yet whether that which you pretend to be Gods will, be ſo indeed, or only your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, this I hope may be queſtioned lawfully and without preſumption; and if we have occaſion we may ſafely put you in mind of <hi>Ezekiel's</hi> commination, againſt all thoſe who ſay, <hi>thus ſaith the Lord,</hi> when they have no certain warrant or authority from him to do ſo.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. <hi>Ad</hi> §. 4. In the fourth Paragraph you deliver this falſe and wicked Doctrin, <hi>that for the procuring our own ſalvation we are always bound under pain of mortal ſin, to take the ſafeſt way, but for avoiding ſin we are not bound to do ſo, but may follow the opinion of any probable Doctors,</hi> though the contrary may be certainly free from ſin, and theirs be
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:57896:201"/>doubtful. Which doctrin in the former part of it is apparently falſe: For though wiſdom and Charity to our ſelves would perſwade us always to do ſo, yet many times, that way which to our ſelves and our ſalvation is more full of hazard, is notwithſtanding not only lawful, but more Charitable and more noble. For example, to flie from a perſecution and ſo to avoid the temptation of it, may be the ſafer way for a mans own ſalvation; yet I preſume no man ought to condemn him of impiety, who ſhould reſolve not to uſe his liberty in this matter; but for Gods greater glory, the greater honour of truth, and the greater confirmation of his brethren in the faith, chooſe to ſtand out the ſtorm and endure the fiery tryal, rather than avoid it; rather to put his own ſoul to the hazard of a temptation, in hope of Gods aſſiſtance to go through with it, than to baulk the opportunity of doing God and his brethren ſo great a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. This part therefore of this Doctrin is manifeſtly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true. The other not only falſe but impious; for therein you plainly give us to underſtand, that in your judgment, a reſolution to avoid ſin, to the uttermoſt of our power, is no neceſſary means of Salvation, nay that a man may reſolve not to do ſo, without any danger of damnation. Therein you teach us, that we are to do more for the love of our ſelves, and our own happineſs than for the love of God; and in ſo doing contradict our Saviour, who expreſly commands us, <hi>to love the Lord our God with all our heart, with all our ſoul, and with all our ſtrength;</hi> and hath taught us <hi>that the love of God conſiſts in avoiding ſin and keeping his commandments.</hi> Therein you directly croſs S. <hi>Pauls</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin, who though he were a very probable Doctor, and had delivered his judgment for the <hi>lawfulneſs of eating meats offered to Idols;</hi> yet he aſſures us that he which ſhould make ſcruple of doing ſo, and forbear upon his ſcruple, ſhould not ſin, but only be <hi>a weak brother;</hi> whereas he, who ſhould do it with a doubtful conſcience, (though the action were by S. <hi>Paul</hi> warranted lawful, yet) <hi>ſhould ſin and be condemned for ſo doing.</hi> You pretend indeed to be rigid defenders and ſtout champions for the neceſſity of
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:57896:201"/>good works; but the truth is, <hi>you ſpeak lies in Hypocriſie,</hi> and when the matter is well examined, will appear to make your ſelves and your own functions neceſſary, but obedience to God unneceſſary: Which will appear to any man who conſiders what ſtrict neceſſity the Scripture impoſes upon all men, of effectual mortification of the habits of all Vices, and effectual Converſion to newneſs of Life, and Univerſal obedience, and withal remembers that an act of Attrition, which you ſay with Prieſtly abſolution is ſufficient to Salvation, is not mortification, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a work of difficulty and time, cannot be performed in an inſtant. But for the preſent, it appears ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly out of this impious aſſertion, which makes it abſolutely neceſſary for men, either in Act if it be poſſible, or if not, in Deſire, to be Baptized and Abſolved by you, and that with Intention: and in the mean time warrants them that for avoiding of ſin, they may ſafely follow the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain guidance of a vain man, who you cannot deny may either be deceived himſelf, or out of malice deceive them, and neglect the certain direction of God himſelf, and their own Conſciences. What wicked uſe is made of this Doctrine, your own long experience can better inform you, than it is poſſible for me to do: yet my own little converſation with you affords me one memorable example to this purpoſe. For upon this ground I knew a young Scholar in <hi>Doway,</hi> licenſed by a great Caſuiſt to ſwear a thing as upon his certain knowledge, whereof he had yet no knowledge but only a great preſumption, <hi>becauſe</hi> (forſooth) <hi>it was the opinion of one Doctor that he might do ſo.</hi> And upon the ſame ground, whenſoever you ſhall come to have a prevailing party in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and power ſufficient to reſtore your Religion, you may do it by depoſing or killing the King, by blowing up of Parliaments, and by rooting out all others of a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Eaith from you. Nay this you may do, though in your own opinion it be unlawful, becauſe

                        <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> a
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:57896:202"/>man with you of approved Vertue, Learning and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, hath declared his opinion for the lawfulneſs of it, in ſaying, that <hi>want of power to maintain a Rebellion, was the only reaſon that the Primitive Chriſtians did not Rebel againſt the perſecuting Emperors.</hi> By the ſame rule, ſeeing the Prieſts and Scribes and Phariſees, men of greateſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute among the <hi>Jews</hi> for Vertue, Learning and Wiſdom, held it a lawful and a pious work to perſecute Chriſt and his Apoſtles, it was lawful for the People to follow their Leaders: for herein, according to your Doctrine, they proceeded prudently, and according to the conduct of opinion, maturoly weighed and approved by men as it ſeemed to them of Vertue, Learning and Wiſdom; nay by ſuch as ſate in <hi>Moſes</hi> Chair, and of whom it was ſaid, <hi>whatſoever they bid you obſerve, that obſerve and do:</hi> which Univerſal you pretend is to be underſtood Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally, and without any reſtriction or limitation. And as lawful was it for the <hi>Pagans</hi> to perſecute the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Chriſtians, becauſe <hi>Trajan</hi> and <hi>Pliny,</hi> men of great Vertue and Wiſdom were of this opinion. Laſtly, that moſt impious and deteſtable Doctrine, (which by a foul calumny you impute to me, who abhor and deteſt it,) that <hi>men may be ſaved in any Religion,</hi> follows from this ground unavoidably. For certainly Religion is one of thoſe things which is neceſſary only becauſe it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded: for if none were commanded under pain of damnation, how could it be damnable to be of any? Neither can it be damnable to be of a falſe Religion, unleſs it be a ſin to be ſo. For neither are men ſaved by good luck, but only by obedience; neither are they damned for their ill Fortune but for ſin and diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Death is the wages of nothing but ſin: and S. <hi>James</hi> ſure intended to deliver the adequate cauſe of ſin and Death in thoſe words, <hi>Luſt when it hath conceived bringeth forth ſin, and ſin when it is finiſhed bringeth forth Death.</hi> Seeing therefore in ſuch things, according to your Doctrine, it is ſufficient for avoiding of ſin, that we proceed prudently, and by the conduct of ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable opinion, maturely weighed and approved by men of
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:57896:202"/>Learning, Vertue and Wiſdom: and ſeeing neither <hi>Jews</hi> want their <hi>Gamaliels,</hi> nor <hi>Pagans</hi> their <hi>Antoninus's</hi> nor any Sect of Chriſtians ſuch profeſſors and maintainers of their ſeveral Sects, as are eſteemed by the People, which know no better (and that very reaſonably) men of Vertue, Learning, and Wiſdom, it follows evidently that the embracing their Religion proceeds upon ſuch reaſon as may warrant their action to be prudent, and this is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for avoiding of ſin, and therefore certainly for avoiding damnation, for that in humane affairs, &amp; diſcourſe, evidence and certainty cannot be always expected. I have ſtood the longer upon the refutation of this Doctrine, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe it is impious, and becauſe bad uſe is made of it, and worſe may be, but only becauſe the contrary po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, <hi>That men are bound for avoiding ſin always to take the ſafeſt way,</hi> is a fair and ſure Foundation, for a clear con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation of the main concluſion, which in this Chapter you labour in vain to prove, and a certain proof that in regard of the precept of Charity towards ones ſelf, and of obedience to God, <hi>Papiſts</hi> (unleſs ignorance ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe them) are in ſtate of ſin as long as they remain in ſubjection to the <hi>Roman</hi> Church.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. for if the ſafer way for avoiding ſin, be alſo the ſafer way for avoiding damnation, then certainly the way of <hi>Proteſtants</hi> muſt be more ſecure, and the <hi>Roman</hi> way more dangerous; take but into your conſideration theſe enſuing Controverſies: Whether it be lawful to worſhip Pictures? to Picture the Trinity? to invocate Saints and Angels? to deny Lay-men the Cup in the Sacrament? to adore the Sacraments? to prohibit certain Orders of Men and Women to Marry? to Celebrate the publick ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God in a language which the aſſiſtants generally underſtand not? and you will not chooſe but confeſs that in all theſe you are on the more dangerous ſide for the committing of ſin, and we on that which is more ſecure. For in all theſe things, if we ſay true, you do that which is impious: on the other ſide if you were in the right, yet we might be ſecure enough, for we ſhould only not do ſomething which you confeſs not neceſſary to be done.
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:57896:203"/>We pretend, and are ready to juſtifie out of principles agreed upon between us, that in all theſe things, you violate the manifeſt commandments of God; and alledge ſuch Texts of Scripture againſt you, as, if you would weigh them with any indifference, would put the matter out of queſtion, but certainly you cannot with any mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty deny, but that at leaſt they make it queſtionable. On the other ſide, you cannot with any face pretend, and if you ſhould, know not how to go about to prove, that there is any neceſſity of doing any of theſe things; that it is unlawful not to worſhip Pictures, not to Picture the Trinity, not to invocate Saints and Angels, not to give all men the entire Sacrament, not to adore the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt, not to prohibit Marriage, not to Celebrate Divine Service in an unknown Tongue: I ſay you neither do nor can pretend that there is any law of God which enjoyns us, no nor ſo much as an Evangelical Council that adviſes us to do any of theſe things. Now <hi>where no law is there can be no ſin, for ſin is the tranſgreſſion of the Law;</hi> It remains therefore that our forbearing to do theſe things, muſt be free from all danger and ſuſpicion of ſin; whereas your acting of them, muſt be, if not certainly impious, without all contradiction queſtionable and dangerous. I conclude therefore that which was to be concluded, that if the ſafer way for avoiding ſin, be alſo (as moſt certainly it is,) the ſafer way for avoiding damnation, then certainly the way of <hi>Proteſtants</hi> muſt be more ſafe, and the <hi>Roman</hi> way more dangerous.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. Ad §. 5.] Here you begin to make ſome ſhew of arguing; and the firſt Argument put into form ſtands thus, <hi>Every leaſt Error in Faith deſtroys the nature of Faith; It is certain that ſome</hi> Proteſtants <hi>do Err, and therefore they want the ſubſtance of Faith.</hi> The Major of which Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſm I have formerly confuted by unanſwerable Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments out of one of your own beſt Authors, who ſhews plainly that he hath amongſt you, as ſtrange as you make it, many other Abettors.

                     <p n="13">13. The Second Argument ſtands thus, <hi>Since all</hi> Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants <hi>pretend the like certainty, it is clear that none of them have any certainty at all:</hi> Which Argument if it were good, then what can hinder but this muſt alſo be ſo, Since <hi>Proteſtants</hi> and <hi>Papiſts</hi> pretend the like certainty; it is clear that none of them have any certainty at all! And this too: Since all Chriſtians pretend the like certainty, it is clear that none of them have any certainty at all! And thirdly this: Since men of all Religions pretend a like certainty, it is clear that none of them have any at all! And laſtly this: Since oft-times they which are abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with a ſpecious Paralogiſm, pretend the like certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with them which demonſtrate, it is clear that none of them have any certainty at all! Certainly Sir, Zeal and the Devil did ſtrangely blind you, if you did not ſee that theſe horrid impieties were the immediate conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of your poſitions, if you did ſee it, and yet would ſet them down, you deſerve worſe cenſure. Yet ſuch as theſe, are all the Arguments wherewith you conceive your ſelf to have proved undoubtedly, that <hi>Proteſtants have reaſon at leaſt to doubt in what caſe they ſtand.</hi>

                     <p n="14">14. Your third and fourth Argument may be thus put into one; <hi>Proteſtants cannot tell what points in particular be Fundamental; therefore they cannot tell whether they or their Brethren do not Err Fundamentally, and whether their difference be not Fundamental.</hi> Both which deductions I have formerly ſhewed to be moſt inconſequent; for know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Scripture to contain all Fundamentals, (though many more points beſides, which makes it difficult to ſay preciſely what is Fundamental and what not,) know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this I ſay and believing it, what can hinder but that I may be well aſſured, that I believe all Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, and that all who believe the Scripture ſincerely as well as I, do not differ from me in any thing Fundamental?</p>
                     <p n="15">15. In the cloſe of this Section, you ſay, that <hi>you omit to add that we want the Sacrament of Repentance inſtitut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the remiſſion of ſins, or at leaſt we muſt confeſs that we hold it not neceſſary: and yet our own Brethren the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury writers acknowledge that in the times of</hi> Cyprian

                        <hi>and</hi> Tertullian, <hi>private Confeſſion even of thoughts was uſed, and that it was then commanded and thought neceſſary; and then our Ordination,</hi> you ſay, <hi>is very doubtful and all that depends upon it.</hi> Anſwer, I alſo omit to anſwer, 1. That your Brother <hi>Rhenanus,</hi> acknowledges the contrary, and aſſures us that the Confeſſion then required and in uſe, was publick, and before the Church, and that your auricular Confeſſion was not then in the World; for which his Mouth is ſtopped by your <hi>Index Expurgatorius.</hi> 2. That your Brother <hi>Arcudius</hi> acknowledges, that the Euchariſt was in <hi>Cyprians</hi> time given to Infants, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed neceſſary, or at leaſt profitable for them, and the giving it ſhews no leſs; and now I would know whether you will acknowledg your Church bound to give it, and to eſteem ſo of it? 3. That it might be then commanded, and being commanded be thought neceſſary, and yet be but a Church Conſtitution. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will I deny, if the preſent Church could, and would ſo order it, that the abuſes of it might be prevented, and conceiving it profitable, ſhould enjoyn the uſe of it, but that being commanded it would be neceſſary. 4. Concerning our Ordinations, beſides that I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it impoſſible that they ſhould be ſo doubtful as yours<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> according to your own principles; I anſwer, that expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience ſhews them certainly ſufficient to bring men to Faith and Repentance, and conſequently to Salvation; and that if there were any ſecret defect of any thing ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, which we cannot help, God will certainly ſupply it.</p>

Ad §. 8.] <hi>Obj.</hi> You ſay there is <hi>un inevitable ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity for us, either to grant Salvation to your Church, or to entail certain damnation upon our own, becauſe ours can have no being till</hi> Luther, <hi>unleſs yours be ſuppoſed to have been the true Church.</hi> I anſwer, this cauſe is no cauſe: For firſt, as <hi>Luther</hi> had no being before <hi>Luther,</hi> and yet he was when he was, though he was not before; ſo there is no repugnance in the terms, but that there might be a true Church after <hi>Luther,</hi> though there were none for ſome Ages before; as ſince <hi>Columbus</hi> his time, there have been Chriſtians in <hi>America,</hi> though before there were none for many Ages. For neither do you ſhew, neither does it appear, that the generation of Churches is Univocal, that nothing but a Church can poſſibly beget a Church: nor that the preſent being of a true Church, depends neceſſarily upon the perpetuity of a Church in all Ages; any more than the preſent being of Peripateticks or Stoicks depends upon a perpetual pedigree of them. For though I at no hand deny the Churches perpetuity, yet I ſee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in your Book to make me underſtand, that the truth of the preſent depends upon it, nor any thing that can hinder, but that a falſe Church, (Gods providence over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>watching and over-ruling it,) may preſerve the means of confuting their own Hereſies, and reducing men to truth, and ſo raiſing a true Church, I mean the integrity
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:57896:205"/>and the Authority of the word of God with men. Thus the <hi>Jews</hi> preſerve means to make men Chriſtians, and <hi>Papiſts</hi> preſerve means to make men <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants</hi> (which you ſay are a falſe Church) do, as you pretend, preſerve means to make men <hi>Papiſts;</hi> that is, their own Bibles, out of which you pretend to be able to prove that they are to be <hi>Papiſts.</hi> Secondly, you ſhew not, nor does it appear that the perpetuity of <hi>the Church</hi> depends on the truth of <hi>yours.</hi> For though you talk vainly, as if you were the only men in the World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Luther,</hi> yet the World knows that this is but talk, and that there were other Chriſtians beſides you, which might have perpetuated the Church though you had not been. Laſtly, you ſhew not, neither doth it appear, that your being acknowledged in ſome ſenſe a true Church, doth neceſſarily import, that we muſt grant Salvation to it, unleſs by it you underſtand the ignorant members of it, which is a very unuſual <hi>Synechdoche.</hi>

                     <p>Therefore the Argument of the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> is as good as that of the <hi>Papiſts</hi> againſt <hi>Proteſtants.</hi> For the <hi>Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts</hi> argued thus, ſpeaking to the <hi>Catholicks, Your ſelves confeſs our Baptiſm, Sacraments and Faith good and avail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.

<pb n="401" facs="tcp:57896:205"/>it is plain, that <hi>Petilian</hi> by his words makes the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> the Church, and excludes the <hi>Catholicks</hi> from ſalvation abſolutely. And whereas you ſay, <hi>the</hi> Catholicks <hi>never yielded that among the</hi> Donatiſts <hi>there was a true Church and hope of Salvation,</hi> I ſay it appears by what I have alledged out of S. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> that they yielded both theſe were among the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> as much as we yield them to be among the <hi>Papiſts.</hi> As for D. <hi>Potters</hi> acknowledgment, <hi>that they maintained an error in the matter and nature of it Heretical:</hi> This proves them but material Hereticks, whom you do not exclude from poſſibility of Salvation.

                     </p>
                     <p n="23">23. Whereas you ſay, <hi>That the Argument for the certainty of their Baptiſm (becauſe it was confeſſed good by Catholicks, whereas the Baptiſm of Catholicks was not confeſſed by them to be good,) is not ſo good as yours, touching the certainty of your Salvation grounded on the confeſſion of Proteſtants, becauſe we confeſs there is no damnable error in the doctrin or practice of the</hi> Roman <hi>Church:</hi> I Anſwer, no: we confeſs no ſuch matter, and though you ſay ſo a hundred times, no repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will make it true. We profeſs plainly, that many dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable errors plainly repugnant to the precepts of Chriſt both Ceremonial and Moral, more plainly than this of Rebaptization, and therefore more damnable, are believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and profeſſed by you. And therefore ſeeing this is the only diſparity you can deviſe, and this is vaniſhed, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains that as good an anſwer as the Catholicks made touching the certainty of their Baptiſm, as good may we

                     <p n="24">24. By the way I deſire to be informed, ſeeing you affirm that <hi>Rebaptizing thoſe whom Hereticks had baptized was a ſacriledge, and a profeſſion of a damnable Hereſie,</hi> when it began to be ſo? If from the beginning it were ſo, then was <hi>Cyprian</hi> a ſacrilegious profeſſor of a damnable hereſie, and yet a Saint and a Martyr. If it were not ſo, then did your Church excommunicate <hi>Firmilian</hi> and others, and ſeparate from them without ſufficient ground of Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication or Separation, which is Schiſmatical.

Now from this Doctrin what is more prone and obvious, than for every natural man (without Gods eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial preventing grace) to make this practical collection; either I am elected, or not elected; if I be, no impiety poſſible can ever damn me: If not, no poſſible induſtry can ever ſave me?

                     <p>I add 1.

Whereas you ſay, <hi>They cannot make their calling certain by good works, who do certainly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that before any good works they are juſtified, and juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by faith alone, and by that faith whereby they certainly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve they are juſtified:</hi> I anſwer, There is no <hi>Proteſtant</hi> but believes that Faith, Repentance, and univerſal Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, are neceſſary to the obtaining of Gods favour and eternal happineſs. This being granted, the reſt is but a ſpeculative Controverſie, a Queſtion about words which would quickly vaniſh, but that men affect not to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:57896:207"/>one another. As if a company of Phyſicians were in conſultation, and ſhould all agree, that three Medicins and no more were neceſſary for the recovery of the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents health, this were ſufficient for his direction towards the recovery of his health; though concerning the proper and ſpecifical effects of theſe three Medicins, there ſhould be amongſt them as many differences as men: So likewiſe being generally at accord that theſe three things, Faith, Hope, and Charity, are neceſſary to ſalvation, ſo that whoſoever wants any of them cannot obtain it, and he which hath them all cannot fail of it, is it not very evident that they are ſufficiently agreed for mens directions to eternal Salvation? And ſeeing Charity is a full compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of all good works, they requiring Charity as a neceſſary qualification in him that will be ſaved, what ſenſe is there in ſaying, <hi>they cannot make their calling certain by good works?</hi> They know what ſalvation is as well as you, and you have as much reaſon to deſire it: They believe it as heartily as you, that there is no good work but ſhall have its proper reward, and that there is no poſſibility of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the eternal reward without good works: and why then may not this Doctrin be a ſufficient incitement and provocation unto good works?</p>
                     <p n="31">31. You ſay, that <hi>they certainly believe that before any good works they are juſtified:</hi> But this is a calumny. There is no <hi>Proteſtant</hi> but requires to Juſtification, Remiſſion of ſins, and to Remiſſion of ſins they all require Repentance, and Repentance I preſume may not be denied the name of a good work, being indeed, if it be rightly underſtood, and according to the ſenſe of the word in Scripture, an effectual converſion from all ſin to all holineſs. But though it be taken for meer ſorrow for ſins paſt, and a bare purpoſe of amendment, yet even this is a good work, and therefore Proteſtants requiring this to Remiſſion of ſins, and Remiſſion of ſins to juſtification, cannot with candor be pretended to believe, that they are juſtified before any good work.</p>
                     <p n="32">32. Obj. You ſay, <hi>They believe themſelves juſtified by faith alone, and that by that faith whereby they believe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves juſtified:</hi>

So that upon the whole matter, a man may truly and ſafely ſay, that the Doctrin of theſe Proteſtants taken altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is not a Doctrin of Liberty, not a Doctrin that turns hope into preſumption, and carnal ſecurity, though it may juſtly be feared, that many licentious perſons, taking it by halves, have made this wicked uſe of it. For my part, I do heartily wiſh, that by publick Authority it were ſo ordered, that no man ſhould ever Preach or Print this Doctrin that Faith alone juſtifies, unleſs he joyns this to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with it, that univerſal obedience is neceſſary to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. And beſides that thoſe Chapters of S. <hi>Paul</hi> which intreat of juſtification by faith, without the works of the Law, were never read in the Church, but when the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Chapter of the firſt Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the abſolute neceſſity of Charity ſhould be, to prevent miſpriſion, read together with them.</p>
                     <p n="33">33. Obj. Whereas you ſay, that <hi>ſome Proteſtants do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly affirm the former point to be the ſoul of the Church,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and that therefore they muſt want the Theological vertue of Hope, and that none can have true hope, while they hope to be ſaved in their Communion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I <hi>Anſwer,</hi> They have great reaſon to believe the Doctrin of Juſtification by faith only, a point of great weight and importance, if it be rightly underſtood: that is, they have reaſon to eſteem it a principal and neceſſary duty of a Chriſtian, to place his hope of juſtification and ſalvation, not in the perfection of his own righteouſneſs (which if it be imperfect will not juſtifie,) but only in the mercies of God through Chriſts ſatisfaction: and yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this, nay the rather for this, may preſerve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:57896:208"/>in the right temper of good Chriſtians, which is a happy mixture and ſweet compoſition of confidence and fear. If this Doctrin be otherwiſe expounded than I have here expounded, I will not undertake the juſtification of it, only I will ſay (that which I may do truly) that I never knew any Proteſtant ſuch a ſoli-fidian, but that he did believe theſe divine Truths; <hi>That he muſt make his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling certain by good works: That he muſt work out his ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with fear and trembling, and that while he does not ſo, he can have no well-grounded hope of Salvation:</hi> I ſay I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver met with any who did not believe theſe divine Truths, and that with a more firm, and a more unſhaken aſſent, than he does that himſelf is predeſtinate, and that he is juſtified by believing himſelf juſtified. I never met with any ſuch, who if he ſaw there were a neceſſity to do either, would not rather forgo his belief of theſe Doctrins than the former: theſe which he ſees diſputed and contradict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and oppoſed with a great multitude of very potent Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments; then thoſe, which being the expreſs words of Scripture, whoſoever ſhould call into queſtion, could not with any modeſty pretend to the title of Chriſtian. And therefore there is no reaſon but we may believe, that their full aſſurance of the former Doctrins doth very well qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie their perſwaſion of the latter, and that the former (as alſo the lives of many of them do ſufficiently teſtifie) are more effectual to temper their hope, and to keep it at a ſtay of a filial and modeſt aſſurance of Gods favor, built upon the conſcience of his love and fear, than the latter can be to ſwell and puff them up into vain confidence and ungrounded preſumption. This reaſon, joyned with our experience of the honeſt and religious converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of many men of this opinion, is a ſufficient ground for Charity, to hope well of their hope: and to aſſure our ſelves that it cannot be offenſive, but rather moſt accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to God, if notwithſtanding this diverſity of opinion, we embrace each ether with the ſtrict embraces of love and Communion. To you and your Church we leave it, to ſeparate Chriſtians from the Church, and to preſcribe them from heaven upon trivial and trifling cauſes: As for
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:57896:208"/>our ſelves, we conceive a charitable judgment of our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren and their errors, though untrue, much more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to God than a true judgment, if it be uncharitable; and therefore ſhall always chuſe (if we do err) to err on the milder and more merciful part, and rather to retain thoſe in our Communion which deſerve to be ejected, than eject thoſe that deſerve to be retained.</p>
                     <p n="34">34. Laſtly, whereas you ſay, that <hi>ſeeing Proteſtants dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer about the point of Juſtification, you muſt needs infer that they want unity in faith, and conſequently all faith, and then that they cannot agree what points are fundamental:</hi> I Anſwer, to the firſt of theſe inferences, that as well might you infer it upon <hi>Victor</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Policrates;</hi> upon <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> and S. <hi>Cyprian:</hi> inaſmuch as it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniably evident, that what one of thoſe eſteemed neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to ſalvation the other eſteemed not ſo. But points of Doctrin (as all other things) are as they are, and not as they are eſteemed: neither can a neceſſary point be made unneceſſary by being ſo accounted, nor an unneceſſary point be made neceſſary by being overvalued. But as the ancient Philoſophers, (whoſe different opinions about the ſoul of man you may read in <hi>Ariſtotle de Anima,</hi> and <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero's Tuſculan Queſtions,)</hi> notwithſtanding their divers opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions touching the nature of the ſoul, yet all of them had ſouls, and ſouls of the ſame nature: Or as thoſe Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans who diſpute whether the brain or heart be the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal part of a man, yet all of them have brains and have hearts, and herein agree ſufficiently: So likewiſe, though ſome Proteſtants eſteem that Doctrin the ſoul of the Church, which others do not ſo highly value, yet this hinders not but that which is indeed the ſoul of the Church may be in both ſorts of them; and though one account that a neceſſary truth which others account neither neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary nor perhaps true, yet this notwithſtanding, in thoſe Truths which are truly and really neceſſary they may all agree. For no Argument can be more ſophiſtical than this: They differ in ſome points which they eſteem ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary; Therefore they differ in ſome that indeed and in truth are ſo.</p>

                     <p n="35">35. Now as concerning the other inference, <hi>That they cannot agree what points are fundamental:</hi> I have ſaid and proved formerly that there is no ſuch neceſſity as you ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin or pretend, that men ſhould certainly know what is, and what is not fundamental. They that believe all things plainly delivered in Scripture, believe all things fundamental, and are at ſufficient Unity in matters of Faith, though they cannot preciſely and exactly diſtinguiſh between what is fundamental and what is profitable: nay though by error they miſtake ſome vain, or perhaps hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful opinions for neceſſary and fundamental Truths.

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:57896:210"/>friendſhips ſake teach me that trick; but until I have learnt it, I pray blame me not for going the ordinary way; I mean for believing or not believing as I ſee rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: If you can convince me of wilful oppoſition againſt the known truth, of negligence in ſeeking it, of unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs to find it, of preferring temporal reſpects before it, or of any other fault, which is in my power to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend, that is indeed a fault, if I amend it not, be as angry with me as you pleaſe. But to impute to me involuntary errors; or that I do not ſee that which I would ſee, but cannot; or that I will not profeſs that which I do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve; certainly this is far more unreaſonable error, than any which you can juſtly charge me with; for let me tell you, the imputing <hi>Socinianiſm</hi> to me, whoſoever was the author of it, was a wicked and groundleſs ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
                  <p>Perhaps you will ſay, for this is the uſual ſong on that ſide, that pride is a voluntary fault, and with this I am juſtly chargeable for forſaking that guide which God has ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed me to follow: But what if I forſook it, becauſe I thought I had reaſon to fear, it was one of thoſe blind guides which whoſoever blindly follows, is threatned by our Saviour that both he and his guide ſhall fall into the Ditch; then I hope you will grant it was not pride, but Conſcience that moved me to do ſo; for as it is wiſe hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility to obey thoſe whom God hath ſet over me, ſo it is ſinful credulity to follow every man or every Church, that without warrant will take upon them to guide me: ſhew me then ſome good and evident title which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> has to this office, produce but one reaſon for it which upon trial will not finally be reſolved and vaniſh into uncertainties; and if I yield not unto it, ſay if you pleaſe I am as proud as Lucifer: in the mean time give me leave to think it ſtrange and not far from a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digee, that this Doctrin of the <hi>Roman</hi> Churches being the guide of faith, if it be true doctrin, ſhould either not be known to the four Evangeliſts, or if it were known to them, that being wiſe and good men, they ſhould either
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:57896:211"/>be ſo envious of the Churches happineſs; or ſo forgetful of the work they took in hand, which was to write the Goſpel of Chriſt, as that not ſo much as one of them ſhould mention ſo much as once, this ſo neceſſary part of the Goſpel, without the belief whereof there is no ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and with the belief whereof, unleſs men be ſnatcht away by ſudden death, there is hardly any damnation. It is evident they do all of them, with one conſent, ſpeak very plainly of many things of no importance in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon hereof: and is it credible or indeed poſſible that with one conſent or rather conſpiracy, they ſhould be ſo deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſilent concerning this <hi>unum neceſſarium?</hi> You may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it if you can, for my part I cannot, unleſs I ſee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration for it: for if you ſay they ſend us to the Church, and conſequently to the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> this is to ſuppoſe that which can never be proved, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is the only Church; and without this ſuppoſal, upon Diviſion of the Church, I am as far to ſeek for a guide of my Faith as ever. As for example,</p>
                  <p>In that great diviſion of the Church when the whole world wondred, ſaith Saint <hi>Hierom,</hi> that it was become <hi>Arrian:</hi> when <hi>Liberius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> (as S. <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> and S. <hi>Hilary</hi> teſtifie) ſubſcribed their Hereſie, and joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Communion with them: Or in the diviſion between the <hi>Greek</hi> and the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, about the proceſſion of the Holy Ghoſt, when either ſide was the Church to it ſelf, and each part Heretical and Schiſmatical to the other; what direction could I then an ignorant man have found from that Text of Scripture, <hi>Unleſs he hear the Church, let him be to thee as a Heathen or a Publican:</hi> or <hi>Upon this Rock will I build my Church and the Gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again, give me leave to wonder, that neither S. <hi>Paul</hi> writing to the <hi>Romans</hi> ſhould ſo much as intimate this their priviledge of Infallibility, but rather on the contrary put them in fear in the eleventh Chapter, that they as well as the Jews were in danger of falling away.</p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:57896:211"/>
                  <p>That Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> the pretended Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> writing two Catholick Epiſtles, mentioning his departure, ſhould not once acquaint the Chriſtians whom he writes to, what guide they were to follow, after he was taken from them.</p>
                  <p>That the writers of the New Teſtament, ſhould ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently forewarn men of Hereticks, falſe Chriſts, falſe prophets, and not once arm them againſt them, with let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them know this onely ſure means of avoiding their danger.</p>
                  <p>That ſo great a part of the New Teſtament ſhould be imployed about Antichriſt, and ſo little or indeed none at all, about the Vicar of Chriſt, and the guide of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</p>
                  <p>That our Saviour ſhould leave this onely means for the ending of Controverſies, and yet ſpeak ſo obſcurely and ambiguouſly of it, that now our Judge is the greateſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie, and the greateſt hinderance of ending them.</p>
                  <p>That there ſhould be better evidence in the Scripture to intitle the <hi>King</hi> to this Office who diſclaims it, than the <hi>Pope</hi> who pretends it.</p>
                  <p>That S. <hi>Peter</hi> ſhould not ever exerciſe over the Apoſtles, any one act of Juriſdiction, nor they ever give him any one Title of Authority over them.</p>
                  <p>That if the Apoſtles did know S. <hi>Peter</hi> was made head over them, when our Saviour ſaid, <hi>Thou art Peter,</hi> &amp;c. they ſhould ſtill contend who ſhould be the firſt; and that our Saviour ſhould never tell them S. <hi>Peter</hi> was the man.</p>
                  <p>That S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſhould ſay, he was in nothing inferiour to the very chief Apoſtles.</p>
                  <p>That the Catechumeniſts in the primitive Church ſhould never be taught this foundation of their Faith, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was Guide of their Faith.</p>
                  <p>That the Fathers, <hi>Tertullian,</hi> S. <hi>Hierom</hi> and <hi>Optatus,</hi> when they flew higheſt in commendation of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, ſhould attribute no more to her than to all other Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical Churches.</p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:57896:212"/>
                  <p>That in the Controverſie about <hi>Eaſter,</hi> the Biſhops and Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> ſhould be ſo ill Catechiſed as not to know this Principle of Chriſtian Religion—The ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of Conformity in Doctrin with the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> That they ſhould never be preſſed with any ſuch neceſſity of conformity in all things, but onely with the Tradition of the Weſtern Churches in that point.</p>
                  <p>That <hi>Irenaeus</hi> and many other Biſhops (notwithſtanding <hi>ad hanc Eccleſiam neceſſe eſt omnem convenire Eccleſiam</hi>) ſhould not yet think that a neceſſary Doctrin, nor a ſufficient ground of Excommunication, which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> though to be ſo.</p>
                  <p>That S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> and the Biſhops of <hi>Africk,</hi> ſhould be ſo ill inſtructed in their Faith, as not to know this founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it. That they likewiſe were never urged with any ſuch neceſſity of Conformity with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> nor ever charged with hereſie or error for denying it.</p>
                  <p>That when <hi>Liberius</hi> joyned in Communion with the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> and ſubſcribed their hereſie, the <hi>Arrians</hi> then ſhould not be the Church, and the Guide of Faith.</p>
                  <p>That never any Hereticks for three Ages after Chriſt, were preſſed with this Argument of the Infallibility of the preſent Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> or charged with denyal of it, as a diſtinct Hereſie; ſo that <hi>Aeneas Sylvius</hi> ſhould have cauſe to ſay, <hi>Ante tempora Concilii Niceni, quiſ<expan>

                        </expan> ſibi vive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat, &amp; parvus reſpectus habebatur ad Eccleſiam Romanam.</hi> That the Eccleſiaſtical Story of thoſe times mentions no Acts of Authority of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> over other Churches; as if there ſhould be a Monarchy, and the Kings for ſome Ages together ſhould exerciſe no act of Juriſdiction in it.</p>
                  <p>That to ſupply this defect, the Decretal Epiſtles ſhould be ſo impudently forged, which in a manner ſpeak nothing elſe but <hi>Reges &amp; Monarchas;</hi> I mean, the Popes making Laws for exerciſing authority over all other Churches.</p>
                  <p>That the <hi>African</hi> Churches in S. <hi>Auſtins</hi> time ſhould be ignorant that the Pope was Head of the Church and Judge of Appeals <hi>jure divino;</hi> and that there was a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:57896:212"/>of Conformity with the Church, in this and all other points of Doctrin.</p>
                  <p>Nay that the <hi>Popes</hi> themſelves ſhould be ſo ignorant of the true ground of this their Authority, as to pretend to it, not upon Scripture or univerſal Tradition, but upon an imaginary pretended none-ſuch Canon of the Council of <hi>Nice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That <hi>Vincentius Lirinenſis</hi> ſeeking for a guide of his Faith and a preſervative from Hereſie, ſhould be ignorant of this ſo ready one, The Infallibility of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All theſe things and many more are very ſtrange to me, if the Infallibility of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church be indeed and were always by Chriſtians acknowledged the foundation of our Faith: And therefore I beſeech you pardon me, if I chooſe to build mine, upon one that is much firmer and ſafer, and lies open to none of theſe objections, which is Scripture and univerſal Tradition; and if one that is of this Faith may have leave to do ſo; I will ſubſcribe with hand and heart,</p>

                  <head>A CONFERENCE BETWIXT Mr. <hi>CHILLINGWORTH</hi> AND Mr. <hi>LEWGAR.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Theſis.</hi> THE Church of <hi>Rome</hi> (taken diffuſively for all Chriſtians communicating with the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi>) was the Judge of Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies at that time, when the Church of <hi>England</hi> made an alteration in her Tenents.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Argu.</hi> She was the Judge of Controverſies at that time, which had an Authority of deciding them. But the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> at that time had the Authority of deciding them. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> A limited Authority to decide Controverſies ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Rule of Scripture and Univerſal Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and to oblige her own Members (ſo long as ſhe evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently contradicted not that Rule) to obedience I grant ſhe had: but an unlimited, an infallible Authority, or ſuch as could not but proceed according to that Rule, and ſuch as ſhould bind all the Churches in the World to Obedience (as the <hi>Greek</hi> Church) I ſay ſhe had not.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> When your Church hath decided a Controverſie, I deſire to know whether any particular Church or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon hath Authority to reexamine her deciſion, whether
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:57896:222"/>ſhe hath obſerved her Rule or no; and free himſelf from the obedience of it, by his or her particular judgment?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> If you underſtand by your Church, the Church Catholick, probably I ſhould anſwer no: but if you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand by your Church, that only which is in Subordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> or if you underſtand a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of this Church, I anſwer, yea.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Arg.</hi> That was the Catholick Church, which did abide in the Root of Apoſtolick Unity: But the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> at that time was the only Church that did abide in the Root of Apoſtolick Unity. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> What mean you by Apoſtolick Unity?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> I mean the Unity of that Fellowſhip wherein the Apoſtles Lived and Died.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> Wherein was this Unity?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Herein it conſiſted, that they all profeſſed one Faith, obeyed one Supream Tribunal, and communicated together in the ſame Prayers and Sacraments.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Solut.</hi> Then the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> continued not in this Apoſtolick Unity; for it continued not in the ſame Faith, wherein the Apoſtles Lived and Died: for though it retained ſo much (in my judgment) as was eſſential to the being of a Church, yet it degenerated from the Church of the Apoſtles times, in many things which were very profitable; as in Latin Service, and Communion in one kind.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Argu.</hi> Some Church did continue in the ſame Faith wherein the Apoſtles lived and died: But there was no Church at that time which did continue in the Apoſtles Faith beſides the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> That ſome Church did continue in the Apoſtles Faith in all things neceſſary, I grant it: that any did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in the Integrity of it, and in a perfect conformity with it in all things expedient and profitable, I deny it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> Is it not neceſſary to a Churches continuing in the Apoſtles Faith, that ſhe continue in a perfect confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity with it in all things expedient and profitable?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> A perfect conformity in all things is neceſſary to a perfect continuance in the Apoſtles Faith: but to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:57896:222"/>an imperfect continuance, an imperfect conformity is ſufficient; and ſuch I grant the <hi>Roman</hi> Church had.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> Is not a perfect continuance in the Apoſtles Faith neceſſary to a Churches continuance in Apoſtolick Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Aſw.</hi> It is neceſſary to a perfect continuance in Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolick Unity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Argu.</hi> There was ſome one company of Chriſtians at the time of <hi>Luthers</hi> riſing, which was the <hi>Catholick Church;</hi> But there was no other company at that time beſides the <hi>Roman: Ergo,</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> at that time was the <hi>Catholick Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> There was no one company of Chriſtians, which in oppoſition to and Excluſion of all other companies of Chriſtians was the Catholick Church.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Argu.</hi> If the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> be ſome one company of Chriſtians in oppoſition to and excluſion of all other companies, then if there was ſome one company, ſhe was one in oppoſition to and excluſion of all other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies: But the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> is one company of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians in oppoſition to and excluſion of, <hi>&amp;c. Ergo,</hi> There was then ſome one company which was the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> in oppoſition to and excluſion of all other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> proved by the Teſtimonies of the Fathers, both Greek and Latin, teſtifying that they underſtood the Church to be <hi>one</hi> in the ſenſe alledged.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. If this Unity which cannot be ſeparated at all or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, is alſo among Hereticks, what contend we farther? Why call we them Hereticks, S. <hi>Cypr. Epiſt.</hi> 75.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But if there be but one Flock, how can he be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted of the Flock, which is not within the number of it? <hi>Id: Ibid.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. When <hi>Parmenian</hi> commends one Church, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns all the reſt; for beſides one, which is the true <hi>Catholick,</hi> other Churches are eſteemed to be among He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, but are not. S. <hi>Optat. lib.</hi> 1.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The Church therefore is but one, this cannot be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all Hereticks and Schiſmaticks. <hi>Ibid.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:57896:223"/>
                  <p n="5">5. You ſay you offer for the Church, which is one; this very thing is part of a lie to call it one, which you have divided into two: <hi>Id: Ibid.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. The Church is <hi>one,</hi> which cannot be amongſt us and amongſt you; it remains then, that it be in one only place. <hi>Id: Ibid.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. Although there be many Hereſies of Chriſtians, and that all would be called <hi>Catholicks,</hi> yet there is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways one Church, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> S. <hi>Auguſt. de util. credend. c.</hi> 7.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. The queſtion between us is, where the Church is, whether with us or with them, for ſhe is but <hi>one. Id: de unitat. c.</hi> 2.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. The proofs of the <hi>Catholick</hi> prevailed, whereby they evicted the Body of Chriſt to be with them, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence not to be with the <hi>Donatiſts;</hi> for it is manifeſt that ſhe is <hi>one</hi> alone. <hi>Id. Collat. Carthag. lib.</hi> 3.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. In illud cantic. 6.7. <hi>There are</hi> 60 <hi>Queens and</hi> 80 <hi>Concubines and Damoſels without number, but my Dove is one,</hi> &amp;c. He ſaid not, <hi>my</hi> Queens are 60, and <hi>my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubines,</hi> &amp;c. but he ſaid my Dove is but one; becauſe all the Sects of Philoſophers and Hereſies of Chriſtians are none of his; his is but one, to wit, the <hi>Catholick</hi> Church, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> S. <hi>Epiphan. in fine Panar.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="11">11. A man may not call the Conventicles of Hereticks (I mean <hi>Marcionites, Manichees,</hi> and the reſt) Churches; therefore the Tradition appoints you to ſay, <hi>I believe one Holy Catholick Church,</hi> &amp;c. S. <hi>Cyrill. Catech.</hi> 18.</p>
                  <p>And theſe Teſtimonies I think are ſufficient to ſhew the judgment of the Ancient Church, that this Title of the Church <hi>one,</hi> is directly and properly excluſive to all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies beſides one; to wit, that where there are diverſe profeſſions of Faith, or diverſe Communions, there is but one of theſe, which can be the <hi>Catholick Church.</hi> Upon this ground I deſire ſome company of Chriſtians to be named, profeſſing a diverſe Faith, and holding a diverſe Communion from the <hi>Roman,</hi> which was the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> at the time of <hi>Luthers</hi> riſing: and if no other in this ſenſe can be named, than was ſhe the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> at that time, and therefore her judgment to be reſted in,

                     <p>Upon the ſame ground, if you pleaſed, you might deſire a Proteſtant to name ſome Company of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, profeſſing a diverſe Faith, and holding a diverſe Communion from the <hi>Greek</hi> Church, which was the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church at the time of <hi>Luthers</hi> riſing; and ſeeing he could name no other in this ſenſe. concludes that the <hi>Greek</hi> Church was the Catholick Church at that time. Upon the very ſame ground you might have concluded for the Church of the <hi>Abyſſines,</hi> or <hi>Armenians,</hi> or any other ſociety of Chriſtians extant before <hi>Luthers</hi> time. And ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this is ſo, thus I argue againſt your ground.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That ground which concludes indifferently for both parts of a contradiction, muſt needs be falſe and deceitful, and conclude for neither part: But this ground concludes indifferently both parts of a contradiction; <hi>viz.</hi> That the <hi>Greek</hi> Church is the Catholick Church, and not the <hi>Roman,</hi> as well as, That the <hi>Roman</hi> is the Catholick Church, and not the <hi>Greek:</hi> Therefore the ground is falſe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful, ſeem it never ſo plauſible.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. I anſwer Secondly, that you ſhould have taken notice of my Anſwer, which I then gave you; which was, that your <hi>major,</hi> as you then framed your Argument, but as now, your <hi>minor</hi> is not always true, if by <hi>one</hi> you under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand <hi>one</hi> in external Communion; ſeeing nothing hindred in my Judgment, but that one Church excommunicated by another upon an inſufficient cauſe, might yet remain a true member of the Catholick Church; and that Church, which upon the overvaluing this cauſe doth excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the other, though in fault, may yet remain a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Catholick Church: which is evident from the difference about <hi>Eaſter-day</hi> between the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and the Churches of <hi>Aſia;</hi> for which vain matter <hi>Victor</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> excommunicated the Churches of <hi>Aſia.</hi> And yet I believe you will not ſay, that either the Church excommunicating, or the Church excommunicated, cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:57896:224"/>to be a true member of the Church Catholick. The caſe is the ſame between the <hi>Greek</hi> and the <hi>Roman</hi> Church; for though the difference between them be greater, yet it is not ſo great, as to be a ſufficient ground of excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication: and therefore the excommunication was cauſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, and conſequently <hi>Brutum fulmen,</hi> and not ratified or confirmed by God in Heaven; and therefore the Church of <hi>Greece</hi> at <hi>Luthers</hi> riſing might be, and was a true member of the Catholick Church.</p>
                     <p>As concerning the places of Fathers, which you alledge; I demand, 1. If I can produce you an equal, or greater number of Fathers, or more ancient than theſe, not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted by any that lived with them or before them, for ſome doctrin condemned by the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, whether you will ſubſcribe it? If not, with what face or conſcience can you make uſe of, and build your whole Faith upon the Authority of Fathers in ſome things, and reject the ſame authority in others?</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Secondly, becauſe you urge S. <hi>Cyprians</hi> Authority, I deſire you to tell me, whether this Argument in his time would have concluded a neceſſity of reſting in the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, or no? If not, how ſhould it come to paſs, that it ſhould ſerve now, and not then, fit this time and not that? as if it were like an Almanack, that would not ſerve for all Meridians? If it would, why was it not urged by others upon S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> or repreſented by S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> to himſelf for his direction, when he differed from the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and all other that herein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed unto her, touching the point of Re-baptizing He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks; which the <hi>Roman</hi> Church held unlawful and damnable, S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> not only lawful, but neceſſary; ſo well did he reſt in the Judgment of that Church: <hi>Quid verba audiam, cùm facta videam,</hi> ſays he in the Comedy? And Cardinal <hi>Perron</hi> tells you in his Epiſtle to <hi>Caſaubon,</hi> that nothing is more unreaſonable, than to draw conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences from the words of Fathers, againſt their lively and actual practice.</p>
                     <p>The ſame may be ſaid in refutation of the places out of S. <hi>Auſtin;</hi> who was ſo far from concluding, from them or
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:57896:224"/>any other, a neceſſity of reſting in the Judgment of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, that he himſelf, as your Authors teſtifie, lived and died in oppoſition of it; even in that main fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental point, upon which Mr. <hi>Lewgar</hi> hath built the neceſſity of his departure from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and embracing the Communion of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, that is, The Supream Authority of that Church over other Churches, and the power of receiving Appeals from them. Mr. <hi>Lewgar,</hi> I know, cannot be ignorant of theſe things; and therefore I wonder, with what conſcience he can produce their words againſt us, whoſe Actions are for us.</p>
                     <p>If it be ſaid, that S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> and S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> were Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks for doing ſo; it ſeems then Schiſmaticks may not only be members of the Church, againſt Mr. <hi>Lewgars</hi> main concluſion, but Canoniz'd Saints of it; or elſe S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> and S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſhould be raſed out of the <hi>Roman</hi> Kalendar.</p>
                     <p>If it be ſaid, that the point of Re-baptization was not defined in S. <hi>Cyprians</hi> time; I ſay that in the Judgment of the Biſhop and Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and their adherents, it was: For they urged it as an Original and Apoſtolick Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and conſequently at leaſt of as great force as any Church definition. They excommunicated <hi>Firmilianus</hi> and condemned S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> as a falſe Chriſt, and a falſe Apoſtle, for holding the contrary; and urged him <hi>Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nico terrore</hi> to conform his judgment to theirs, as he himſelf clearly intimates.</p>
                     <p>If it be ſaid, they differed only from the particular Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and not from the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, taking it for the univerſal ſociety of Chriſtians in Communion with that Church: I Anſwer,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. They know no ſuch ſenſe of the word, I am ſure never uſed it in any ſuch; which whether it had been poſſible, if the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> had been in their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to other Churches in ſpiritual matters, as the City was to other Cities and Countries in temporals, I leave it to indifferent men to judge.</p>
                     <pb n="8" facs="tcp:57896:225"/>
                     <p n="2">2. Secondly, that they differed not only from the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar <hi>Roman</hi> Church, but alſo from all other Churches, that agreed with it in thoſe doctrins.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Thirdly, I deſire you would anſwer me directly, whether the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, taking it for that particular Church, be of neceſſity to be held Infallible in Faith by every <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick, or not. To this Queſtion I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly deſire a direct anſwer without tergiverſation, that we may at length get out of the cloud, and you may ſay, <hi>Coram, quem quaeritis, adſum.</hi> If you ſay, they are not bound to believe ſo; then it is no Article of Faith, nor no certain truth upon which men may ſafely reſt without fluctuation or fear of error: And if ſo; I demand</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Why are all your Clergy bound to ſwear, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently your Laity (if they have Communion of Faith with them) by your own grounds, bound to believe, That the <hi>Roman</hi> Church is the Miſtris of all other Churches? where it is evident from the relation and oppoſition of the <hi>Roman</hi> to other Churches, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Church is there taken for that particular Church.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Secondly, why then do you ſo often urge that mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken ſaying of <hi>Iraeneus, Ad hanc Eccleſiam neceſſe eſt om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem convenire Eccleſiam?</hi> falſely tranſlating it, as Cardinal <hi>Perron</hi> in <hi>French,</hi> and my <hi>L. F.</hi> in <hi>Engliſh—All Churches muſt agree with this Church;</hi> for <hi>convenire ad</hi> ſignifies not to <hi>agree with,</hi> but to <hi>come unto;</hi> whereas it is evident for the aforeſaid reaſon, that the <hi>Roman</hi> is here taken for that particular Church.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Thirdly, if that particular Church be not certainly infallible, but ſubject to error in points of faith; I would know, if any diviſion of your Church ſhould happen, in which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> either alone, or with ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſhould take one way; the Churches of <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> and many other Churches another, what direction ſhould an ignorant Catholick have then from the pretended Guide of Faith? How ſhall he know which of theſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies is the Church? ſeeing all other Churches diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from the <hi>Roman</hi> may err, and ſeeing the <hi>Roman</hi> Church is now ſuppoſed ſubject to error, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:57896:225"/>not certain to guard thoſe men, or thoſe Churches that adhere unto it from erring.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Fourthly, if that particular Church be not infallible in Faith, let us then ſuppoſe that <hi>de facto</hi> it does err in faith; ſhall we not then have an Heretical head upon a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick body? A head of the Church, which were no mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Church? which ſure were a very ſtrange and heterogeneous Monſter! If to avoid theſe inconveniences you will ſay, that <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks muſt of neceſſity hold that particular Church infallible in faith; I ſuppoſe it will evidently follow, that S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> and S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding thoſe ſentences you pretend out of them) were no <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks; ſeeing they lived and died in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary belief and profeſſion. Let me ſee theſe abſurdities fairly and clearly avoided, and I will diſpute no more, but follow you whitherſoever you ſhall lead me.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Thirdly, I anſwer, that the places alledged are utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly impertinent to the concluſion you ſhould have proved; which was, That it was impoſſible, that two Societies of Chriſtians divided upon what cauſe ſoever in external Communion, may be in truth and in Gods account, both of them parts of the Catholick Church: whereas your te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies, if we grant them all, ſay no more but this; That the Societies of Hereticks, which are ſuch as over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw any doctrin neceſſary to ſalvation; and of Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks, which are ſuch as ſeparate from the Churches Communion without any pretence of error in the Church or unlawfulneſs in the conditions of her Communion; I ſay, they prove only this, that ſuch Societies as theſe, are no parts of the Church: which I willingly grant of all ſuch, as are properly and formally Hereticks and Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks; from which number I think (with S. <hi>Auſtin</hi>) they are to be exempted, <hi>Qui quaerunt cautâ ſollicitudine veritatem, corrigi parati, cùm invenerint.</hi> Whereas I put the caſe of ſuch two Societies, which not differing indeed in any thing neceſſary to ſalvation, do yet erroneouſly believe that the errors wherewith they charge one another, are damnable, and ſo by this opinion of mutual error, are kept on both ſides from being Hereticks.</p>
                     <pb n="10" facs="tcp:57896:226"/>
                     <p>Becauſe I deſire to bring you and others to the truth, or to be brought to it by you, I thought good for your di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection in your intended Reply, to acquaint you with theſe things:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That I conceive the—in your diſcourſe is this. That whenſoever any two Societies of Chriſtians differ in external Communion, one of them muſt be of neceſſity Heretical or Schiſmatical. I conceive there is no ſuch ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity; and that the ſtories of <hi>Victor</hi> and the Biſhops of <hi>Aſia,</hi> S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> and Pope <hi>Stephen</hi> make it evident; and therefore I deſire you to produce ſome convincing argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the contrary; and that you may the better do it, I thought good to inform you what I mean by an <hi>Heretick,</hi> and what by a <hi>Schiſmatick.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>An <hi>Heretick</hi> therefore I conceive him, that holds an Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror againſt Faith with obſtinacy. Obſtinate I conceive him, who will not change his Opinion, when his reaſons for it are ſo anſwered, that he cannot reply; and when the reaſons againſt it are ſo convincing, that he cannot anſwer them. By the Faith I underſtand all thoſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines and no more, which Chriſt taught his Apoſtles, and the Apoſtles the Church; yet I exclude not from this number the certain and evident deductions of them.</p>
                     <p>A <hi>Schiſmatick</hi> I account him, (and <hi>Facundus Hermia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenſis</hi> hath taught me to do ſo) who, without any ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of error in the conditions of a Churches Communion, divides himſelf either from the obedience of that Church to which he owes obedience; or from the Communion of that Church to which he owes Communion.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Another thing, which I thought fit to acquaint you with, is this: That you go upon another very falſe and deceitful ſuppoſition; <hi>viz.</hi> that if we will not be <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants,</hi> preſently we muſt be <hi>Papiſts;</hi> if we forſake the Church of <hi>England,</hi> we muſt go preſently to the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> Whereas if your Arguments did conclude (as they do not) that before <hi>Luthers</hi> time, there was ſome Church of one Denomination, which was the Catholick Church; I ſhould much rather think it were the Church of <hi>Greece,</hi> than the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> and I believe others alſo would
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:57896:226"/>think ſo as well as I, but for that reaſon which one gives, why more men hold the Pope above a Council, than a Council above a Pope, that is, becauſe Councils give no maintenance or preferment, and the Popes do.</p>
                     <p>Think not yet, I pray, that I ſay this, as if I concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved this to be your reaſon for preferring the <hi>Roman</hi> Church before the <hi>Greek;</hi> (for I proteſt I do not) but rather, that conceiving verily you were to leave the Church of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> to avoid trouble you took the next Boat, and went to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> becauſe that beſpake you firſt.</p>
                     <p>You impute to me (as I hear) that the way I take is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive only, and that I build nothing; which firſt, is not a fault; for Chriſtian Religion is not now to be built; but only I deſire to have the rubbiſh and impertinent Lumber taken off, which you have laid upon it, which hides the glorious ſimplicity of it from them which otherwiſe would embrace it. Remember, I pray, <hi>Averroes</hi> his ſaying; <hi>Quandoquidem Chriſtiani adorant quod comedunt, ſit anima mea cum Philoſophis;</hi> and conſider the ſwarms of Atheiſts in <hi>Italy,</hi> and then tell me, whether your unreaſonable and contradictious Doctrines, your forged Miracles and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit Legends have not in all probability produced this ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. Secondly, if it be a fault, it is certainly your own; for your diſcourſe intended for the proof of a poſitive con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion — <hi>That we muſt be Papiſts</hi> — proves <hi>in deed and in truth</hi> nothing; but even <hi>in ſhew and appearance</hi> no more but this Negative, that we muſt not be Proteſtants; but what we muſt be, if we muſt not be Proteſtants, God knows; you in this Diſcourſe (I am ſure) do not ſhew it.</p>

                     <head>Mr. <hi>Lewgars</hi> Reply.</head>
                     <p>§. 1. The minor of Mr. <hi>Chillingworths</hi> Argument againſt my ground is very weak, being framed upon a falſe ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, that a Proteſtant could name no other Church profeſſing a diverſe Faith, &amp;c. from the <hi>Greek</hi> Church, which was the Catholick Church: for if he could not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed name any other, the title would remain to the <hi>Greek</hi> Church: But he hath the <hi>Roman</hi> to name, and ſo my ground cannot conclude, either for the <hi>Greek</hi> or <hi>Abyſſine</hi> or
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:57896:227"/>any other, beſides the <hi>Roman,</hi> but for that it does, except he can name ſome other.</p>
                     <p>§. 2. His ſecond anſwer is weak likewiſe; for my Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor is always true; at leaſt they thought it to be ſo, whoſe Authorities I produce in confirmation of it, as will appear to any one that conſiders them well; how their force lies in <hi>Theſi,</hi> not in <hi>Hypotheſi;</hi> not that the Church was not then divided into more Societies than one, but that ſhe could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be.</p>
                     <p>§. 3. As for his Inſtance to the contrary, wherein he believes I will not ſay the Churches excommunicated by <hi>Victor</hi> ceaſed to be a true member of the Catholick: If I ſay ſo, I ſay no more than the Ancient Fathers ſaid before me. <hi>Iraeneus</hi> when he deſired <hi>Victor</hi> 
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, not to cut off ſo many and great Churches; and <hi>Ruffinus, reprehendit eam, quod non benè feciſſet abſcindere ab unitate corporis,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>§. 4. But howſoever the caſe of Excommunication may be, the diviſion of external Communion which I intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the Fathers ſpake of in the alledged Authorities, was that which was made by voluntary ſeparation.</p>
                     <p>§. 5. Whereby the Church (before one Society) is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into ſeveral diſtinct Societies, both claiming to be the Church; of which Societies ſo divided, but one can be the Catholick; and this is proved by the Authorities al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged; which Authorities muſt not be anſwered by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving them, as he does (for that is to change his Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, and confute the Fathers ſayings, inſtead of mine) but by ſhewing their true ſenſe or judgment to be otherwiſe than I alledged it.</p>
                     <p>§. 6. To his demand upon the places alledged I An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that I do not build my whole faith of this concluſion upon the Authority of thoſe Fathers; for I produce them, not for the Authority of the thing, but of the Expoſition. The thing it ſelf is an Article of the Creed, <hi>Unam Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licam;</hi> grounded in expreſs Scripture, <hi>Columba mea unica:</hi> but becauſe there is difference in underſtanding this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie, I produce theſe Authorities, to ſhew the Judgment of the Ancient Church how they underſtood it; and the proper anſwer to this is either to ſhew, that theſe words
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:57896:227"/>were not there, or at leaſt, not this meaning; and ſo to ſhew their meaning out of other places more pregnant.</p>
                     <p>§. 7. And I promiſe, that whenſoever an equal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of Fathers can be ſhewed for any thing, as I can ſhew for this, I will believe it as firmly as I do this.</p>
                     <p>§. 8. But this is not the Anſwerers part, to propound doubts and difficulties, but to ſatisfie the proof objected.</p>
                     <p>§. 9. And if this courſe be any more taken, I will ſave my ſelf all farther labour in a buſineſs ſo likely to be endleſs.</p>
                     <p>§. 10. His ſecond Anſwer to the places is wholly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent; for therein would he diſprove them from watching a neceſſity of reſting in the judgment of the <hi>Roman Church;</hi> whereas I produced them only to ſhew, that among ſeveral Societies of Chriſtians, only <hi>one</hi> can be the <hi>Catholick;</hi> and againſt this his ſecond Anſwer ſaith nothing.</p>
                     <p>§. 11. In his third Anſwer he makes ſome ſhew of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to the Authorities themſelves; but he commits a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Error: One, that he impoſes upon me a wrong con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion to be proved, as will appear by comparing my concluſion in my Paper, with the concluſion he would appoint me.</p>
                     <p>§. 12. Another, that he impoſes upon the Authorities a wrong Interpretation, no way grounded in the words themſelves, nor in the places whence they were taken, nor in any other places of the ſame Fathers, but meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forged out of his own Brain. For firſt, the places do not only ſay, that the Societies of Hereticks and Schiſmaticks are no part of the Church; but that the Church cannot be divided into more Societies than <hi>one;</hi> and they account Societies divided, which are either of a diverſe Faith or a diverſe Communion. Neither do they define <hi>Hereticks</hi> or <hi>Schiſmaticks</hi> in that manner as he does.</p>
                     <p>§. 13. For an <hi>Heretick</hi> in their Language is he, that oppoſes partinaciouſly the Common Faith of the Church: and a <hi>Schiſmatick,</hi> he that ſeparates from the <hi>Catholick</hi> Communion; never making any mention at all of the cauſe.</p>
                     <pb n="14" facs="tcp:57896:228"/>
                     <p>§. 14. And if his definition of a <hi>Schiſmatick</hi> may ſtand, then certainly there was no <hi>Schiſmatick</hi> ever in the World, nor none are at this day: for none did, none does ſeparate without ſome pretence of Error, or unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs in the Conditions of the Churches Communion.</p>
                     <p>§. 15. And ſo I expect both a fuller and directer anſwer to my Argument, without excurſions, or diverſions into any other matter, till the judgment of Antiquity be clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this point.</p>

The <hi>Minor</hi> of my Argument, you ſay, is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry weak, being grounded upon a falſe Suppoſition, That a Proteſtant could name no other Church profeſſing a diverſe Faith from the <hi>Greek,</hi> which was the <hi>Catholick</hi> Church: And your reaſon is, becauſe he might name the <hi>Roman.</hi> But in earneſt, Mr. <hi>Lewgar,</hi> do you think that a Proteſtant remaining a Proteſtant, can eſteem the <hi>Roman</hi> Church to be the Catholick Church? or do you think to put tricks upon us, with taking your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition one while <hi>in ſenſu compoſito,</hi> another while <hi>in ſenſu diviſo?</hi> For if your meaning was, that a Proteſtant not remaining, but ceaſing to be a Proteſtant, might name the <hi>Roman</hi> for the <hi>Catholick;</hi> ſo I ſay alſo to your diſcourſe, that a Proteſtant ceaſing to be a Proteſtant, might name a <hi>Greek</hi> to be the <hi>Catholick</hi> Church; and if there were any neceſſity to find out one Church of one denomination, as the <hi>Greek,</hi> the <hi>Roman,</hi> the Abyſſine, which <hi>one</hi> muſt be the <hi>Catholick?</hi> I ſee no reaſon, but he might pitch upon the <hi>Greek</hi> Church, as well as the <hi>Roman;</hi> I am ſure your diſcourſe proves nothing to the contrary. In ſhort, thus I ſay, if a <hi>Grecian</hi> ſhould go about to prove to a Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, that his Church is the <hi>Catholick,</hi> by ſaying (as you do for the <hi>Roman</hi>) ſome one was ſo before <hi>Luther,</hi> and you can name no other, therefore ours is ſo: Whatſoever may be anſwered to him, may be anſwered to you. For as you ſay, a Proteſtant, ceaſing to be a Proteſtant, may name to him the <hi>Roman;</hi> ſo I ſay, a Proteſtant, ceaſing to be a Proteſtant, may name to you the <hi>Grecian.</hi> If
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:57896:228"/>you ſay, a Proteſtant, remaining a Proteſtant, can name no other but the <hi>Roman,</hi> for the <hi>Catholick;</hi> I may (very ridiculouſly I confeſs, but yet as truly) ſay, he can name no other but the <hi>Grecian.</hi> If you ſay, he cannot name the <hi>Greek Church</hi> neither, remaining a Proteſtant; I ſay likewiſe, neither remaining a Proteſtant, can he name the <hi>Roman</hi> for the <hi>Catholick.</hi> So the Argument is equal in all reſpects on both ſides; and therefore either concludes for both parts (which is impoſſible, for then contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſhould be both true) or elſe (which is certain) it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes for neither. And therefore I ſay, your ground you build on, That before <hi>Luther</hi> ſome Church of one deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination was the <hi>Catholick</hi> (if it were true, as it is moſt falſe) would not prove your intent. It would deſtroy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps our Church, but it would not build yours. It would prove peradventure, that we muſt not be Proteſtants, but it will be far from proving that we muſt be <hi>Papiſts.</hi> For after we have left being Proteſtants (I tell you again that you may not miſtake) there is yet no neceſſity of being <hi>Papiſts;</hi> no more than if I go out of <hi>England,</hi> there is a neceſſity of going to <hi>Rome.</hi> And thus much to ſhew the poorneſs of your ground, if it were true. Now in the ſecond place, I ſay it is falſe, neither have you proved any thing to the contrary.</p>
                     <p>Ad §. 2. You ſay, the Authorities you have produced, ſhew to any that conſider them well, That the Church could never be divided into more Societies than <hi>one;</hi> and you mean (I hope) <hi>one</hi> in external Communion, or elſe you dally in ambiguities; and then I ſay, I have well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered the alledged authorities, and they appear to me to ſay no ſuch thing; but only, that the Societies of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks and Schiſmaticks are no true members of the Church: Whereas I put the caſe of two ſuch Societies, which were divided in external Communion by reaſon of ſome over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valued difference between them, and yet were neither of them Heretical or Schiſmatical. To this I know you could not anſwer, but only by ſaying, That this ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition was impoſſible; <hi>viz.</hi> That of two Societies divided in external Communion, neither ſhould be Heretical nor
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:57896:229"/>Schiſmatical; and therefore I deſired you to prove by one convincing Argument, that this is impoſſible. This you have not done, nor I believe can do; and therefore all your places fall ſhort of your intended concluſion; and if you would put them into Syllogiſtical form, you ſhould preſently ſee you conclude from them Sophiſtically in that fallacy, which is called <hi>A dicto ſecundum quid, ad di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum Simpliciter.</hi> Thus, — No two divided Societies, whereof one is Heretical or Schiſmatical, can be both members of the <hi>Catholick Church:</hi> therefore ſimply no two divided Societies can be ſo: the Antecedent I grant, which is all that your places ſay, as you ſhall ſee anon; but the conſequence is Sophiſtical, and therefore that I deny: It is no better nor worſe than if you ſhould argue thus; No true divided Societies, whereof one is Out-law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and in Rebellion, are both members of the ſame Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth; therefore ſimply no two divided Societies.</p>
                     <p>But againſt this you pretend, That the alledged places ſay not only, that the Societies of Hereticks and Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks are no parts of the Church; but that the Church cannot be divided into more Societies than <hi>one:</hi> And they account Societies divided, which are either of a diverſe Faith, or of a diverſe Communion: This is that which I would have proved, but as yet I cannot ſee it done. There be Eleven Quotations in all; ſeven of them ſpeak expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and formally of diviſion made by Hereticks and Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks, <hi>viz.</hi> 1.3, 4. 7.9, 10, 11. Three other of them, (<hi>viz.</hi> 5, 6.8.) though they uſe not the word, yet Mr. <hi>Lewgar</hi> knows they ſpeak of the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> which were Schiſmaticks; and that by the relative particles <hi>you</hi> and <hi>them</hi> are meant the <hi>Donatiſts.</hi> And laſtly, the ſecond, Mr. <hi>Lewgar</hi> knows, ſays nothing but this, That an Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks cannot be accounted of that one Flock, which is the Church.</p>
                     <p>But to make the moſt of them that can be: The firſt ſaith, the Unity of the Church cannot be ſeparated at all, nor divided. This I grant, but then I ſay, every differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence does not in the ſight of God divide this Unity: for then diverſity of Opinions ſhould do it; and ſo the <hi>Jeſuits</hi>
                        <pb n="17" facs="tcp:57896:229"/>and <hi>Dominicans</hi> ſhould be no longer members of the ſame Church. Or if every difference will not do it, why muſt it of neceſſity be always done by difference in Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, upon an inſufficient ground, yet miſtaken for ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient? (for ſuch only I ſpeak of.) Sure I am, this place ſays no ſuch matter. The next place ſaies, the Flock is but one; and all the reſt, that the Church is but <hi>one,</hi> and that Hereticks and Schiſmaticks are not of it; which certainly was not the thing to be proved, but that of this one Flock, of this one Church, two Societies divided without juſt cauſe in Communion, might not be true and lively members; both in one Body Myſtical in the ſight of God, though divided in Unity in the ſight of men: It is true indeed, whoſoever is ſhut out from the Church on Earth, is likewiſe cut off from it before God in Heaven: but you know it muſt be <hi>Clave non errante;</hi> when the cauſe of abſciſſion is true and ſufficient.</p>
                     <p>Ad §. 3. If you ſay ſo, <hi>you ſay no more than the Fathers:</hi> but what evaſions and tergiverſations are theſe? Why do you put us off with <hi>ifs</hi> and <hi>ands?</hi> I beſeech you tell me, or at leaſt him that deſires to reap ſome benefit by our Conference, directly and Categorically, — Do you ſay ſo, or do you ſay, it is not ſo? Were the Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated Churches of <hi>Aſia</hi> ſtill members of the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> (I mean in Gods account) or were they not? but all damned for that horrible Hereſie of celebrating the Feaſt of <hi>Eaſter</hi> upon a diverſe day from the Weſtern Churches? If you mean honeſtly and fairly, anſwer di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to this Queſtion, and then you ſhall ſee what will come of it. Aſſure your ſelf, you have a Wolf by the Ears: If you ſay they were, you overthrow your own concluſions, and ſay that Churches divided in Communion may both be members of the <hi>Catholick.</hi> If they were not; then ſhall we have Saints and Martyrs in Heaven, which were no members of the <hi>Catholick Roman Church.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As for <hi>Irenaeus</hi> his <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, and <hi>Ruffinus</hi> his — <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcindere ab unitate corporis;</hi> they imply no more but this at the moſt; That <hi>Victor (quantum in ſe fuit)</hi> did cut them off from the <hi>External</hi> Communion of the <hi>Catholick Church;</hi>
                        <pb n="18" facs="tcp:57896:230"/>ſuppoſing, that for their Obſtinacy in their Tradition, they had cut themſelves off from the <hi>internal</hi> Communion of it: but that this ſentence of <hi>Victors</hi> was ratified in Heaven, and that they were indeed cut off from the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Body of Chriſt, ſo far was <hi>Irenaeus</hi> from thinking, that he, and in a manner all the other Biſhops, reprehended <hi>Victor</hi> for pronouncing this Sentence on them, upon a cauſe ſo inſufficient: which how they could ſay, or poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly think of a Sentence ratified by God in Heaven, and not reprehend God himſelf, I deſire you to inform me: and if they did not intend to reprehend the Sentence of God himſelf, together with <hi>Victors,</hi> then I believe it will follow unavoidably, that they did not conceive, nor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve <hi>Victors</hi> Sentence to be ratified by God; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently did not believe, that theſe excommunicated Churches were not in Gods account true members of the Body of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Ad §. 4. And here again, we have another ſubterfuge, by a Verbal diſtinction between Excommunication, and voluntary ſeparation: As if the ſeparation, which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> made in <hi>Victors</hi> time from the <hi>Aſian Churches,</hi> were not a voluntary ſeparation; or as if the Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> did not voluntarily do that which was the cauſe of their ſeparation; or as if (though they ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not themſelves indeed, conceiving the cauſe to be inſufficient) they did not yet remain voluntarily ſeparated, rather than conform themſelves to the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> Or laſtly, as if the <hi>Grecians</hi> of Old, or the Proteſtants of Late, might not pretend as juſtly as the <hi>Aſian</hi> Churches, that their Separation too was not voluntarily, but of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity; for that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> required of them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pain of Excommunication ſuch conditions of her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, as were neither neceſſary nor lawful to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</p>
                     <p>Ad §. 5. And here again the matter is ſtreightned by another limitation. Both ſides (ſay you) muſt claim to be the Church: but what then, if one of them only claim (though vainly) to be the Church, and the other content it ſelf with being a part of it? Theſe then it ſeems
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:57896:230"/>(for any thing you have ſaid to the contrary) may be both members of the <hi>Catholick Church:</hi> And certainly this is the caſe now, between the Church of <hi>England</hi> and the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> and for ought I know, was between the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and the Church of <hi>Greece:</hi> For I believe, it will hardly be proved, that the Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation between them was mutual; nor that the Church of <hi>Greece</hi> eſteems it ſelf the whole Church, and the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> no Church but it ſelf a ſound member of the Church, and that a corrupted one.</p>
                     <p>Again, whereas you ſay, the Fathers ſpeak of a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary ſeparation; certainly they ſpeak of any Separation by Hereticks; and ſuch were (in <hi>Victors</hi> judgment) the Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> for holding an opinion contrary to the Faith, as he eſteemed: Or if he did not, why did he cut them from the Communion of the Church? But the true difference is, The Fathers ſpeak of thoſe, which by your Church are eſteemed Hereticks, and are ſo; whereas the <hi>Aſian</hi> Churches were by <hi>Victor</hi> eſteemed Hereticks, but were not ſo.</p>
                     <p>Ad §. 6. But their Authorities produced ſhew no more, than what I have ſhewed; that the Church is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ut one in excluſion of Hereticks and Schiſmaticks; and not that two particular Churches divided by miſtake upon ſome overvalued difference, may not be both parts of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Ad §. 7. But I deſire you to tell me, whether you will do this, if the Doctrines produced and confirmed by ſuch a conſent of Fathers, happen to be in the judgment of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> either not <hi>Catholick,</hi> or abſolutely Heretical. If you will undertake this, you ſhall hear farther from me: But if, when their places are produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, you will pretend (as ſome of your ſide do) that ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they are corrupted, having neither reaſon nor ſhew of reaſon for it; unleſs this may paſs for one (as perhaps it may, where reaſons are ſcarce) that they are againſt your Doctrine; or if you will ſay, they are to be interpreted according to the pleaſure of your Church, whether their words will bear it or no; then I ſhall but loſe my Labour;
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:57896:231"/>for this is not to try your Church by the Fathers, but the Fathers by your Church.</p>
                     <p>The Doctrines which I undertake to juſtifie, by a greater conſent of Fathers than here you produce, for inſtance ſhall be theſe.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That Gods Election ſuppoſeth preſcience of mans Faith and perſeverance.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That God doth not predetermine men to all their Actions.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That the <hi>Pope</hi> hath no power in temporalties over Kings either directly or indirectly.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. That the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> may Err in his publick de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations of matters of Faith.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. That the B. <hi>Virgin</hi> was guilty of Original ſin.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. That the B. <hi>Virgin</hi> was guilty of actual ſin.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. That the Communion was to be adminiſtred to the Laity in both kinds.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. That the reading of the Scripture was to be denied to no man.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. That the Opinion of the Millenaries is true.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. That the Euchariſt is to be adminiſtred to Infants.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. That the ſubſtance of Bread and Wine remains in the Euch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">

                     <p n="12">12. That the Souls of the Saints departed enjoy not the Viſion of God before the Laſt day.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. That at the day of judgment, all the Saints ſhall paſt through a purging fire.</p>
                     <p>All theſe propoſitions are held by your Church either Heretical, or at leaſt not <hi>Catholical;</hi> and yet in this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of yours you have undertaken to believe them as firmly, as you now do this, That two divided Societies cannot be both members of the <hi>Catholick Church.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Ad §. 8. Is it not then the Anſwerers part to ſhew, that the proofs pretended are indeed no proofs? and doth not he prove no proofs (at leaſt in your mouth) who undertakes to ſhew, that an equal or greater number of the very ſame witneſſes is rejected by your ſelves in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other things? Either the conſent of the Fathers, in any Age or Ages, is infallible, and then you are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:57896:231"/>it in nothing; or it is not ſo, and then you are not to urge it in any thing: As if the Fathers Teſtimonies againſt us were Swords and Spears, and againſt you bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſhes.</p>
                     <p>Ad §. 9. In effect as if you ſhould ſay, If you anſwer not as I pleaſe, I will diſpute no longer. But you remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the proverb, — will think of it. — <hi>Occaſionem quaerit, qui cupit diſcedere.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Ad §. 10. I pray tell me, Is not <hi>Therefore</hi> a note of an Illation, or a concluſion? And is not your laſt <hi>therefore this, Therefore her judgment is to be reſted in?</hi> which though it be not your firſt concluſion, yet yours it is, and you may not declaim it: and it is ſo near of kin to the former (in your judgment I am ſure) that they muſt ſtand or fall together: therefore he that ſpeaks pertinently for the diſproving of the one, cannot ſpeak impertinently to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the diſproving the other: and therefore you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſo ſhift it off, but of neceſſity you muſt anſwer the Argument there urged, or confeſs it ingenuouſly to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anſwerable.</p>
                     <p>Or if you will not anſwer any thing, where the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction of your firſt concluſion is not in terms infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, then take it thus: If S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> and S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> did not think it neceſſary in matters of Faith to reſt in the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church and the adherents of it; Then either they thought not the <hi>Catholick Churches</hi> judgment neceſſary to be reſted on, or they thought not <hi>that</hi> the <hi>Catholick Church.</hi> But the Antecedent is true, and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niably proved ſo by their Actions, and the conſequence Evident: Therefore the conſequent muſt be true in one or other part: But you will not ſay the former is true; it remains therefore, the latter muſt be, and that is — That S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> and S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> did not think the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and the adherents of it to be the Catholick Church.</p>
                     <p>Ad §. 11. But I tell you now, and have already told you, that in our diſcourſe before Mr. <hi>Skinner</hi> and Dr. <hi>Sheldon.</hi> I anſwered your Major, as then you framed your Argument, as now your Minor thus — If you underſtand
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:57896:232"/>by <hi>one company</hi> of Chriſtians, <hi>one</hi> in External Communion, I deny your Major. For I ſay, that two ſeveral Societies of Chriſtians, which do not externally communicate toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, may be both parts of the ſame Catholick Church: and what difference there is between this, and the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion I told you, you ſhould have proved, I do not well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand.</p>
                     <p>Ad §. 12. And is it poſſible you ſhould ſay ſo, when every one of the places carry this ſenſe in their forehead, and 7 of the 11 in terms expreſs it — That they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended only to exclude Hereticks and Schiſmaticks from being parts of the Church: For if they did not, againſt whom did they intend them? <hi>Pagans</hi> lay no claim to the Church, therefore not againſt them: <hi>Catholicks</hi> they did not intend to exclude: I know not who remains beſides, but Hereticks and Schiſmaticks. Beſides the frequent op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition in them between—<hi>One Church</hi> on the one ſide, and Hereticks and Schiſmaticks; who ſees not, that in theſe places they intended to exclude only theſe pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers out of the Churches Unity?</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, whereas you ſay, that the places ſay—That the Church cannot be divided; and that they account thoſe divided who are of a diverſe Faith, or a diverſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion: I tell you, that I have read them over and over, and unleſs my Eyes deceive, they ſay not one word of a <hi>diverſe Communion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Ad §. 13. Whereas a <hi>Heretick</hi> in your Language, is he that oppoſeth pertinaciouſly the common Faith of the Church;—In mine—He is ſuch a one, as holds an Error againſt Faith with Obſtinacy: Verily a monſtrous difference between theſe definitions. To oppoſe and hold againſt (I hope) are all one: <hi>Faith</hi> and the <hi>common Faith of the Church,</hi> ſure are not very different: <hi>pertinaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly</hi> and <hi>with Obſtinacy,</hi> methinks might paſs for Synoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous; and ſeeing the parts agree ſo well, methinks the Total ſhould not be at great hoſtility. And for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition of a <hi>Schiſmatick,</hi> if you like not mine (which yet I give you out of a Father) I pray take your own; and then ſhew me, (if you mean to do any thing) that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:57896:232"/>there are two Societies of Chriſtians, differing in external Communion, one of them moſt be of neceſſity either Heretical, or Schiſmatical in your own ſenſe of theſe words. To the contrary, I have ſaid already, (and ſay it now again, that you may not forget it) the <hi>Roman</hi> and the <hi>Aſian</hi> Churches in <hi>Victors</hi> time, the <hi>Roman</hi> and the <hi>African</hi> in S. <hi>Stephens</hi> time differed in external Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and yet neither of them was <hi>Heretical;</hi> For they did not oppoſe pertinaciouſly the common Faith of the Church: Neither of them was <hi>Schiſmatical;</hi> for they did not ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate (never making mention of the cauſe at all) but were ſeparated by the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and that upon ſome cauſe, though it were not ſufficient.</p>
                     <p>Ad §. 14. The <hi>Donatiſt</hi> did ſo (as <hi>Facundus Hermianenſis</hi> teſtifies:) but you are abuſed, I believe, with not diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing between theſe two — They did pretend, that the Church required of them ſome unlawful thing among the conditions of her Communion: and they did pretend, that it was unlawful for them to communicate with the Church. This I confeſs they did pretend; but it was in regard of ſome Perſons in the Church, with whom they thought it unlawful to communicate: But the former they did not pretend, (I mean while they continued meer Schiſmaticks,) <hi>viz.</hi> That there was any Error in the Church, or impiety in her publick ſervice of God: And this was my meaning in ſaying,—A Schiſmatick is he, which ſeparates from the Church without pretence of Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, or unlawfulneſs in the conditions of her Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Yet if I had left out the term <hi>unlawfulneſs,</hi> the defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition had been better, and not obnoxious to this Cavil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation; and ſo I did in the ſecond Paper which I ſent you for your direction; which if you had dealt candidly, you ſhould have taken notice of.</p>
                     <p>Ad §. 15. I have replied (as I think) fully to every part and particle of your Argument. Neither was the Hiſtory of S. <hi>Cyprians</hi> and S. <hi>Auſtins</hi> oppoſition to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> an excurſion or diverſion; but a cleer demonſtation of the contradictory of your concluſion: (<hi>viz. That the</hi> Roman <hi>Church,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and therefore her judgment not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:57896:233"/>upon</hi>) For an anſwer hereto I ſhall be very importunate with you; and therefore, if you deſire to avoid trouble, I pray come out of my debt as ſoon as may be.</p>
                     <p>If it be ſaid, that my Argument is not contradictory to your concluſion; becauſe it ſhews only, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Church with her adherents was not in S. <hi>Cyprians</hi> or S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtins</hi> time the Catholick Church, but was at the time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Luther;</hi> I ſay, to conclude the one is to conclude the other. For certainly, if it were then at <hi>Luthers</hi> time ſo, it was always ſo; if it was not always, it was not then: for if it be of the eſſence, or neceſſary to the Church (as is pretended) to be a Society of Chriſtians joyned in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the Church and Biſhop of <hi>Rome;</hi> then did it always agree to the Church; and therefore in S. <hi>Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> and S. <hi>Auſtins</hi> time, as well as at <hi>Luthers</hi> riſing: if it were not always, particularly not in S. <hi>Cyprians</hi> time, of the Eſſence or neceſſary to the Church to be ſo; then it was impoſſible the Church ſhould acquire this Eſſence, or this property afterwards, and therefore impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible it ſhould have it at the time of <hi>Luthers</hi> riſing. <hi>Neceſsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium eſt, quod non aliquando ineſt, aliquando non ineſt, ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cui ineſt, alicui non ineſt; ſed quod ſemper &amp; omni.</hi> Ariſt. Poſt. Analyt.</p>
                     <p>Again, every Sophiſter knows, that of Particulars no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be concluded; and therefore he that will ſhew, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and the adherents of it was the Catholick Church at <hi>Luthers</hi> riſing; He muſt argue thus; — It was always ſo, therefore then it was ſo: Now this Antecedent is overthrown by any Inſtance to the contrary; and ſo the firſt Antecedent being proved falſe, the firſt conſequent cannot but be falſe; for what Reaſon can be imagined, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and the Adherents of it, was not the whole Catholick Church at S. <hi>Cyprians</hi> time, and was at <hi>Luthers</hi> riſing? If you grant (as I think you cannot deny) that a Church divided from the Communion of the <hi>Roman,</hi> may be ſtill in truth and in Gods account a part of the Catholick (which is the thing we ſpeak of:) then I hope Mr. <hi>Lewgars</hi> Argument from Unity of Communion is fallen to the ground; and it will be no good Plea to ſay,</p>
                     <pb n="25" facs="tcp:57896:233"/>
                     <p>Some one Church, not conſiſting of divers Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, was the Catholick Church at <hi>Luthers</hi> riſing:</p>
                     <p>No one Church can be named to be the Catholick Church, but the <hi>Roman:</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Therefore the <hi>Roman</hi> Church was the Catholick at <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> riſing.</p>
                     <p>For Mr. <hi>Lewgar</hi> hath not nor cannot prove the Major of this ſyllogiſm certainly true; but to the contrary I have proved, that it cannot be certainly true, by ſhewing di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers inſtances, wherein divers divided Communions have made up the Catholick Church: and therefore not the dividing of the Communions, but the cauſe and ground of it, is to be regarded, whether it be juſt and ſufficient, or unjuſt and inſufficient.</p>
                     <p>Neither is the Biſhop or Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> with the Adherents of it, an infallible Judge thereof; for it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, both he and it have erred herein divers times; which I have evinced already by divers examples, which I will not repeat; but add to them one confeſſed by Mr. <hi>Lewgar</hi> himſelf in his diſcourſe upon the Article of the Catholick Church, pag. 84. <hi>S.</hi> Athanaſius <hi>being excommunicated (though by the

                  <head>II. <hi>A Diſcourſe againſt the Infallibility of the</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church, <hi>with an Anſwer to all thoſe Texts of Scripture that are alledged to prove it.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THE Condition of Communion with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> without the performance whereof no man can be received into it, is this, That he believe firmly and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubting, whatſoever that Church requires him to believe.</p>
                  <p>It is impoſſible that any man ſhould certainly believe any thing, unleſs that thing be either evident of it ſelf (as that twice two are four; that every whole is greater than a part of it ſelf) or unleſs he have ſome certain reaſon (at leaſt ſome ſuppoſed certain reaſon) and infallible guide for his belief thereof.</p>
                  <p>The Doctrins which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> requireth to be believed are not <hi>evident of themſelves;</hi> for then every one would grant them at firſt hearing without any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proof. He therefore that will believe them, muſt have ſome certain and infallible ground whereupon to build his belief of them.</p>
                  <p>There is no other ground for a mans belief of them, eſpecially in many points, but only an aſſurance of the Infallibility of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now this point of that Churches Infallibility, is not evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of it ſelf; for then no man could chuſe but in his heart believe it without farther proof. Secondly, it were in vain to bring any proof of it, as vain as to light a Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle to ſhew men the Sun. Thirdly, it were impoſſible to bring any proof of it, ſeeing nothing can be more evident, than that which of it ſelf is evident: and nothing can be brought in proof of any thing which is not more evident than that matter to be proved: But now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience teacheth that millions there are, which have heard talk of the Infallibility of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and yet do not believe that the defenders of it do not think it either vain or impoſſible to go about to prove it; and from hence it follows plainly, that this point is not evident of it ſelf.</p>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:57896:234"/>
                  <p>Neither is there any other certain ground for any mans belief of it: or if there be, I deſire it may be produced, as who am ready and moſt willing to ſubmit my judgment to it, fully perſwaded that none can be produced, that will endure a ſevere and impartial examination.</p>
                  <p>If it be ſaid, The <hi>Roman</hi> Church is to be believed infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble becauſe the Scripture ſays it is ſo.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. I demand how ſhall I be aſſured of the Texts that be alledged, that they are indeed Scripture, that is, the Word of God? And the anſwer to this muſt be either becauſe the Church tells me ſo, or ſome other: if any other be given, then all is not finally reſolved into, and built upon that Churches Authority; and this anſwer then I hope a Proteſtant may have leave to make uſe of, when he is put to that perillous Queſtion; <hi>How know you the Scripture to be the Scripture?</hi> If the anſwer be, becauſe the Church tells me ſo: my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply is ready; that to believe that Church is infallible, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Scriptures ſay ſo: and that the Scripture is the word of God, becauſe the ſame Church ſays ſo, is nothing elſe but to believe the Church is infallible, becauſe the Church ſays ſo, which is infallible.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I could never yet from the beginning of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> to the end of the <hi>Apocalypſe,</hi> find it written ſo much as once in expreſs terms, or equivalently, that the Church in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination to the Sea of <hi>Rome</hi> ſhall be always infallible.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If it be ſaid, that this is drawn from good conſequence from Scripture truly interpreted; I demand, what certain ground have I to warrant me, that this conſequence is good and this interpretation true: and if anſwer be made, that reaſon will tell me ſo: I reply, 1. That this is to build all upon my own reaſon and private interpretation. 2. I have great reaſon to fear, that reaſon aſſures no man, that the infallibility of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> may be deduced from Scripture, by good and firm conſequence.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. If it be ſaid, that a Conſent of Fathers do ſo inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret the Scripture. I anſwer, 1. That this is moſt falſe and cannot without impudence be pretended, as I am ready to juſtifie to any indifferent Hearer. 2. I demand, who ſhall be judge whether the Fathers mean as is pretended.
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:57896:235"/>If it be ſaid, reaſon will tell me ſo: I ſay, 1. this is falſe. 2. This is again to do that which is objected to Proteſtants for ſuch a horrid crime, that is, to build all finally upon reaſon.</p>
                  <p>If it be ſaid, they are ſo interpreted by the Catholick Church; I demand, whether by the Catholick Church be meant that onely that is in ſubordination to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> or any other with that, or beſides that. If any other, it is falſe and impudent to pretend that they ſo underſtand the Fathers or Scriptures: If that only, then this is to ſay, that that Church is infallible, becauſe it may be deduced from Scripture that it is ſo; and to prove that it may be deduced from Scripture, becauſe the Fathers ſay ſo; and to prove the Fathers do ſay and mean ſo, becauſe the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ſays they do ſo. And then what a ſtir and trouble was here to no purpoſe; why was it not rather ſaid plainly at the beginning; The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is certainly infallible, becauſe ſhe her ſelf ſays ſo; and ſhe muſt ſay true becauſe ſhe is infallible: and that is as much to ſay as unleſs you grant me the Queſtion, I neither can nor will diſpute with you.</p>
                  <p>If it is ſaid, indeed the Fathers do not draw this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin from Scripture, but yet they affirm it with a full con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, as a matter of Tradition. I reply. 1. That this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence alſo is falſe, and that upon tryal it will not appear to have any colour of probability to any who remembers, that it is the preſent <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and not the Catholick Church whoſe infallibility is here diſputed. 2. I demand, who ſhall be judge, whether the Fathers do indeed affirm this or no: If reaſon, then again we are fallen upon that dangerous Rock, that all muſt be reſolved into private reaſon: If the Church I ask again, what Church is meant? If the Church of the <hi>Grecians</hi> or <hi>Abyſſines</hi> or Proteſtants, or any other but the <hi>Roman,</hi> it is evident they deny it. If the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> then we are again very near the head of the Circle. For I ask, how ſhall I be aſſured this Church will not err and deceive me in interpreting the Fathers; and the Anſwer muſt be either none, or this, that the Church is infallible.</p>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:57896:235"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> If it be ſaid, that the Infallibility of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church would yield the Church ſo many commodities, and that the want of an infallible Church to guide men in the way to Heaven, would bring ſo many miſchiefs upon the world, that it cannot be thought but that God out of his love to men, hath appointed this Church as an infallible guide to all other Churches; ſeeing it is ſo neceſſary there ſhould be ſome ſuch guide, and ſo evident there is no other.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> I anſwer, that this argument would ſerve the Church of <hi>Greece,</hi> or <hi>England,</hi> or <hi>Geneva,</hi> to prove it ſelf infallible, and the guide of all other Churches, would they but take upon them to be ſo. For every one might ſay for it ſelf; It is neceſſary there ſhould be ſome Guide; it is evident there is no other; <hi>Ergo</hi> I am appointed by God to be that Guide. The ſame argument any man might uſe, to make himſelf Monarch of any popular State: for firſt he might repreſent unto them the commodities of a Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, and the miſchiefs of a Democracy: then he might ſay, That God ſurely out of his Love to them hath appointed ſome remedy for their inconveniences: And laſtly, that he hath ordained no other to redreſs them but himſelf, and then conclude, that he alone muſt of neceſſity be the man appointed to rule over them.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer Secondly, that here alſo we muſt reſolve all into Reaſon and the private Spirit, or that we are ſtill in the Circle. For I demand, how do you know that theſe pretended commodities are to be compaſſed, and theſe pretended miſchiefs are to be avoided, only by the Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> or ſome other Church, and not by any other means which God hath provided. If you ſay, reaſon tells you ſo; I ſay 1. This is to make reaſon your laſt and loweſt foundation. 2. I aſſure you Reaſon tells me no ſuch matter, and yet I know that I am as willing to hear it as you are. If you ſay, the Church tells you ſo, and ſhe is infallible; this, I ſay, is to prove the Church infallible becauſe ſhe is ſo.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, I demand, How it is poſſible you ſhould know, that theſe pretended commodities might not be gained,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:57896:236"/>and theſe miſchiefs which you fear avoided, without any aſſiſtance of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>'s infallibility, if all men in the world did believe the Scripture, and live according to it, and would require no more of others, but to do ſo? If you ſay, that notwithſtanding this, there would be no unity in Doctrin: I anſwer 1. It is impoſſible you ſhould know this; conſidering that there are many places in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, which do more than problably import, that the want of piety in living, is the cauſe of want of unity in believing. 2. That there would be unity of Opinion in all things neceſſary: and that in things not neceſſary unity of Opinion is not neceſſary. But laſtly, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding differences in theſe things of leſſer importance, there might and would be unity of Communion, uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of charity and affection, which is one of the greateſt bleſſings which the world is capable of; abſolute unity of opinion being a matter rather to be deſired than hoped for.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> Againſt this it has been objected, that the Scripture cannot be the guide, becauſe many men have uſed their beſt endeavors to follow it, and yet have fallen, ſome into <hi>Arianiſm,</hi> others into <hi>Pelagianiſm,</hi> others into other damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Hereſies, and how can I ſecure any man, but he may do the like?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> To this I anſwer, by diſtinguiſhing the perſons which are pretended to have made uſe of this Guide, and yet to have fallen into Hereſie, that they were either ſuch as did love the truth ſincerely and above all things, as did ſeek it diligently and with all their power, to this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent that they might conform their belief and life unto it; ſuch as following S. <hi>Pauls</hi> direction, did firſt try all things deliberately, and then choſe what in their conſcience they thought was beſt: or they were ſuch as for want of the love of the truth, God ſuffered to fall into ſtrong deluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to fall to a falſe Religion, becauſe they brought not forth the fruits of the true; to make ſhipwreck of their faith, becauſe they had caſt away a good conſcience; to have their Eyes blinded, and their light taken away, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they made not the right uſe of it, but were idle and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:57896:236"/>unprofitable, and ſet their hearts upon vanity, and had on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a form of Religion, but denied the effect of it in their lives and converſations; in a word, ſuch as were betrayed to their Error, and kept for ever in it, either by negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in ſeeking the Truth, or unwillingneſs to find it, or by ſome other voluntary ſin: And for theſe I dare not flatter them with hope of pardon; but let me tell you, it is not the error of the underſtanding, but the ſin of their will that truly and properly damns them: But for the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer I am confident, that nothing is more contumelious to the goodneſs of God, than to think that he will damn any ſuch; for he ſhould damn men that truly love him, and deſire to ſerve him, for doing that which all things conſidered, was impoſſible for them not to do.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> If it is ſaid, that pride of their own underſtanding made them not ſubmit to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and to her guidance, and that for this, being a voluntary ſin, they may be juſtly damned.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> I anſwer, that whether the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> be the guide of all men is the Queſtion, and therefore not to be begged but proved: that the man we ſpeak of is very wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to follow this Guide, could he find any good ground to believe it is his Guide; and therefore the reaſon he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows her not, is not pride but ignorance: that as it is hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility to obey thoſe whom God hath ſet over us, ſo it is credulity to follow every one that will take upon him to lead us: that if the <hi>blind lead the blind,</hi> not only the <hi>leader</hi> but the <hi>follower</hi> ſhall periſh: Laſtly, that the preſent Church of <hi>Rome</hi> pretends very little and indeed nothing of moment, to get the office of being Head and Guide of the Church, which Antichriſt when he cometh, may not and will not make uſe of, for the very ſame end and purpoſe; and therefore he had reaſon, not to be too ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and precipitate, in committing himſelf to the conduct of the Pope, for fear of miſtaking Antichriſt for the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> But in all Commonwealths, it is neceſſary there ſhould be not only a Law for men to live by, but alſo a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and ſpeaking Judge to decide their differences ariſing
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:57896:237"/>about the various Interpretations of the Law, and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe Controverſies would be endleſs: therefore if ſuch a judge be ſo neceſſary in civil affairs, for the procuring and preſerving our temporal peace and happineſs; how much more neceſſary is he, for the deciding of thoſe Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies, that concern the ſaving and damning of our ſouls for ever.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> Hereunto I anſwer, 1. That if it were as evident and certain that God hath appointed the Pope or Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to be the Guide of Faith, and Judge of Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies, as that the King hath appointed ſuch a one to be Lord Chief Juſtice, the having of ſuch a Guide would be very available, for to preſerve the Church in Unity, and to conduct mens ſouls to Heaven: but a Judge that has no better title or evidence to his place, than the Pope has to that which he pretends to, a Judge that is doubtful and juſtly queſtionable whether he be the Judge or no, is in all probability likely to produce clean contrary effects, and to be himſelf one of the Apples of ſtrife, one of the greateſt ſubjects of Controverſie, and occaſion of diſſentions.</p>
                  <p>And to avoid this great inconvenience, if God had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the Pope or Church of <hi>Rome</hi> for this great Office, certainly he would have ſaid ſo very plainly and very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently; if not frequently, certainly ſometimes, once at leaſt he would have ſaid ſo in expreſs terms: but he does not ſay ſo, no not ſo much as once, nor any thing from whence it may be collected, with any ſure or firm conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence: therefore if it be not certain, certainly it is very probable he never meant ſo.</p>
                  <p>Again, in Civil Controverſies the caſe can hardly be ſo put, that there ſhould be any neceſſity that the ſame man ſhould be Judge and Party: but in matters of Religion, wherein all have equal intereſt, every man is a party, and engaged to judge for temporal reſpects, this way or that way, and therefore not fit to be a Judge. But what then if he which was with ſo much clamor and ſo little reaſon vouched, for the Infallibility of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, do tell you plainly, there is no living Judge on Earth appointed by God, to decide the Controverſies ariſing amongſt
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:57896:237"/>Chriſtians; nor no way to determine them but Scripture. His words are expreſs and formal, and need no other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary but a true interpretation.</p>

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:57896:238"/>But to what end do we ſollicite Heaven, when we have here in the Goſpel a Will and Teſtament?

So alſo Chriſt, as long as he was preſent on Earth (though neither now is he wanting) for a time commanded his Apoſtles, whatſoever was neceſſary. But juſt as an Earthly Father, when he feels his Death approaching, fearing leſt after his Death the Brothers ſhould fall out and quarrel, he calls in Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, and tranſlates his Will from his dying Heart into Writing-Tables that will continue long after him: Now if any controverſie ariſes among the Brothers; they do not go to his Tomb, but conſult his laſt Will; and thus he whilſt he reſts in his Grave, does ſpeak to them in thoſe ſilent Tables as if he were alive. He whoſe Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment we have, is in Heaven. Therefore we are to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire his pleaſure in the Goſpel, as in his laſt Will and Teſtament.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is plain from hence, that he knew not of any living, ſpeaking, audible Judge, furniſhed with Authority and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility to decide this controverſie: had he known any ſuch aſſiſted with the Spirit of God for this purpoſe, it had been horrible impiety againſt God and the Churches peace, to ſay there was none ſuch: or the Spirit of God was not able by his aſſiſtance to keep this Judge from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hindred with partiality, from ſeeing the Truth. Had he thought the Biſhop of <hi>Romes</hi> ſpeaking <hi>ex Cathedra</hi> to be this Judge, now had been the time to have ſaid ſo: but he ſays directly the contrary, and therefore it is plain, he knew of no ſuch Authority he had.</p>
                  <p>Neither is there the like reaſon for a Judge finally and with Authority to determine controverſies in Religion and civil differences: For if the controverſie be about <hi>Mine</hi> and <hi>Thine,</hi> about Land or Money or any other thing, it is impoſſible that both I ſhould hold the poſſeſſion of it and my adverſary too: and one of us muſt do injury
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:57896:238"/>to the other, which is not fit it ſhould be Eternal: But in matters of Doctrine the caſe is clean contrary; I may hold my opinion and do my Adverſary no wrong, and my Adverſary may hold his and do me none.</p>

                  <p>Now before we proceed further, let us reflect upon theſe places, and make the moſt of them for the behoof
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:57896:239"/>of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church; and I believe it will then appear to any one not veil'd with prejudice, that not one of them reaches home to the concluſion intended, which is, That the <hi>Roman</hi> Church is infallible.</p>
                  <p>The firſt place perhaps would do ſomething, but that there are Three main exceptions againſt it. 1. That here is no evidence, not ſo much as that of probability, that this is here ſpoken of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> 2. That it is certain that it is not ſpoken of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> but of the Nation of the <hi>Jews,</hi> after their converſion, as is apparent from that which follows. <hi>Zion ſhall be redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with judgment, and her converts with righteouſneſs.</hi> 3. That it is no way certain, that whatſoever Society may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>the City of righteouſneſs, the faithful City,</hi> muſt be infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible in all her Doctrine: with a great deal more probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, it might challenge from hence the priviledg of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Impeccable;</hi> which yet <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> I believe do not pretend to.</p>
                  <p>The Second place is liable to the ſame exceptions; the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is not ſpoken of in it: but <hi>Zion</hi> and <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem;</hi> and it will <hi>ſerve as well nay</hi> better to prove <hi>Impec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cability</hi> than <hi>Infallibility.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The third place is the <hi>Achilles</hi> for this opinion, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in every writer Triumphs; but I wonder they ſhould do ſo; conſidering the Covenant here ſpoken of is made, not with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> but with <hi>Zion</hi> and them that turn from tranſgreſſion in <hi>Jacob,</hi> the words are: <hi>And the Redeemer ſhall come out of</hi> Zion, <hi>and unto them that turn from tranſgreſſion in</hi> Jacob <hi>ſaith the Lord. As for me, this is my Covenant with them ſaith the Lord; My Spirit that is in thee and my Words,</hi> &amp;c. Now if the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> be <hi>Zion</hi> and they that turn from iniquity in <hi>Jacob,</hi> they may have Title to this Covenant; if not they muſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear, and leave it to the <hi>Jews</hi> after their Converſion; to whom it is appropriated by a more Infallible Interpreter than the <hi>Pope;</hi> I mean S. <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 11.26. And it ſeems the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> alſo believes as much: for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe why does ſhe in the Margent of her Bible, ſend us to that place of S. <hi>Paul</hi> for an expoſition.</p>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:57896:239"/>
                  <p>Read the 4th place, and you ſhall find nothing can be made of it but this: that the Watchmen of <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> ſhall never ceaſe importuning God, for the ſending of the <hi>Meſſias:</hi> To this purpoſe ſpeaks the Prophet in <hi>ver.</hi> 1. <hi>For</hi> Zions <hi>ſake I will not hold my peace,</hi> and for <hi>Hieruſalems ſake I well not reſt, until the righteouſneſs thereof go forth as brightneſs:</hi> And the <hi>Gentiles ſhall ſee thy righteouſneſs.</hi> But the words following theſe that are objected, make it moſt evident, which are, <hi>ye that make mention of the Lord keep not ſilence, and give him no reſt, till he eſtabliſh and till he make</hi> Hieruſalem <hi>a praiſe in the Earth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The 5th place had they ſet down entirely, for very ſhame they could not have urged it for the Infallibility of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. The words are, <hi>Behold the days come, ſaith the Lord, that I will make a new Covenant with the Houſe of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and with the Houſe of</hi> Judah; <hi>not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Covenant which I made with their Fathers — But this ſhall be the Covenant that I will make with the Houſe of</hi> Iſrael — <hi>After thoſe days, ſaith the Lord, I will put my Law in their inward parts and write it in their Hearts, and I will be their God and they ſhall be my People; and they ſhall teach no more every man his Neighbour and every man his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſaying, know the Lord; for they ſhall all know me from the leaſt of them to the greateſt of them, ſaith the Lord.</hi> And now I have tranſcribed the place, I think it ſuperfluous to make any other anſwer.</p>
                  <p>The ſame Anſwer and no other will I make alſo to the 6th place. The words are. <hi>Therefore ſay unto the Houſe of</hi> Iſrael; <hi>thus ſaith the Lord God, I do not this for your ſakes O Houſe of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>but for my holy names ſake,</hi> ver. 22. <hi>I will take you from among the Heathen, and gather you out of all Countries, and will bring you into your own Land,</hi> v. 24. <hi>Then will I ſprinkle clean Water upon you,</hi> ver. 25. <hi>A new heart alſo will I give you,</hi> ver. 26. <hi>And I will put my Spirit in you and cauſe you to walk in my Statutes, and ye ſhall keep my judgments and do them,</hi> ver. 27. <hi>And ye ſhall dwell in the Land that I gave to your Fathers: I will alſo ſave you from all your uncleanneſſes, and I will call for the Corn and will encreaſe it, and lay no Famine upon you. And the deſolate Land
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:57896:240"/>ſhall be tilled,</hi> ver. 34. <hi>And they ſhall ſay, this Land that was deſolate, is become like the Garden of</hi> Eden.</p>
                  <p>The 7th place alſo carries its anſwer in its forehead: <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord God, behold I will take the Children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>from among the</hi> Heathen <hi>whether they be gone; and I will make them one Nation in the Land upon the mountains of</hi> Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael: <hi>and one King ſhall be King to them all,</hi> &amp;c. to the end of the Chapter. In all which place, he that can find a Syllable of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> he muſt have better eyes than I have.</p>
                  <p>The next (8th) place would be very pregnant for the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> if of courteſie we would grant, that whatſoever is promiſed to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> is intended to them. As you may ſee in the place at large, from <hi>ver.</hi> 17. to the end of the Chapter.</p>
                  <p>The 9th and laſt place out of the <hi>Canticles,</hi> had it been urged by a Proteſtant; it would have been thought a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Anſwer to have ſaid, That Myſtical Texts are not fit to argue upon; but if this will not ſerve, then we an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. 1. That there is no mention nor intimation of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> 2. That it proves either too much or nothing at all: that is, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Church is impec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable, as well as infallible; unleſs we will ſay that Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors only are Spots, and impieties are not.</p>

                  <head>III. <hi>A Conference, concerning the Infallibility of the</hi> Roman <hi>Church: Proving that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Church of</hi> Rome <hi>either errs in her worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the Bleſſed Virgin</hi> Mary, <hi>or that the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Church did err in condemning the</hi> Collyridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans <hi>as</hi> Hereticks.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Demand.</hi> WHether the Infallibility of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, be not the foundation of their Faith which are members of that Church?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Infallibility of the Church is (not the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation but) a part of their Faith who are members of the Church. And the <hi>Roman</hi> Church is held to be the Church, by all thoſe who are members of it.</p>
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:57896:242"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reply.</hi> That which is the laſt Reaſon, why you believe the Scripture to be the written Word of God and unwrit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Traditions his unwritten word; and this or that to be the true ſenſe of Scripture, that is to you the foundation of your Faith, and ſuch unto you is the Infallible Authority of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. Therefore unto you it is not only a part of your faith, but alſo ſuch a part as is the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all other parts. Therefore you are deceived if you think, there is any more oppoſition between being a part of the faith and the foundation of other parts of it; than there is between being a part of a houſe and the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it. But whether you will have it the foundation of your faith, or only a part of it, for the preſent purpoſe it is all one.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Demand.</hi> Whether the Infallibility of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church be not abſolutely overthrown, by proving the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Roman</hi> Church is in error, or that the <hi>Ancient</hi> was?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is, if the Error be in thoſe things wherein ſhe is affirmed to be infallible; <hi>viz.</hi> in points of Faith.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reply.</hi> And this here ſpoken of, whether it be lawful to offer Tapers and Incenſe to the honour of the Bleſſed Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, is I hope a Queſtion concerning a point of Faith.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Demand.</hi> Whether offering a Cake to the Virgin <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> be not as lawful, as to offer Incenſe and Tapers and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers other oblations to the ſame Virgin?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is as lawful to offer a Cake to her honour as Wax-Tapers, but neither the one, nor the other may be offered to her, or her honour, as the term or object of the Action. For to ſpeak properly, nothing is offered to her or to her honour, but to God in the honour of the Bleſſed Virgin. For Incenſe, it is a foul ſlander that it is offered any way to the Bleſſed Virgin; for that incenſing which is uſed in the time of Maſs, is ever underſtood by all ſorts of people to be directed to God only.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reply.</hi> If any thing be offered to her, ſhe is the Object of that oblation; as if I ſee water, and through water ſomething elſe, the water is the object of my ſight, though not the laſt object. If I honour the Kings Deputy, and by him the King, the Deputy is the object of my action, though not the final object: And to ſay theſe things may
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:57896:242"/>be offered to her, but not as to the object of the action, is to ſay they may be offered to her, but not to her. For what elſe is meant by the object of an action, but that thing on which the action is imployed, and to which it is directed?</p>
                  <p>If you ſay, that by the object of the action, you mean the final object only wherewith the action is termina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; you ſhould then have ſpoken more properly and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly, and not have denied her ſimply to be the object of this action, when you mean only ſhe is not ſuch a kind of object: no more than you may deny a man to be a living creature, meaning only that he is not a horſe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I ſay, it is not required of <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks when they offer Tapers to the Saints, that by an actual in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention they direct their action actually to God; but it is held ſufficient, that they know and believe that the Saints are in Subordination and near Relation to God, and that they give this honour to the Saints becauſe of this relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: And to God himſelf rather habitually and interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, than actually, expreſly and formally. As many men honour the Kings Deputy, without having any preſent thought of the King, and yet their action may be interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted an honour to the King, being given to his Deputy, only becauſe he is his Deputy, and for his relation to the King.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, I ſay, there is no reaſon or ground in the world, for any man to think, that the <hi>Collyridians</hi> did not chuſe the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> for the object of their worſhip, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than any other Woman or any other Creature, meerly for her relation to Chriſt; and by conſequence there is no ground to imagine, but that at leaſt habitually and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretative, they directed their action unto Chriſt, if not actually and formally. And <hi>Ergo,</hi> if that be a ſufficient defence for the Papiſts, that they make not the Bleſſed Virgin the final object of their worſhip, but worſhip her not for her own ſake, but for her relation unto Chriſt: <hi>Epiphanius</hi> ſurely did ill to charge the <hi>Collyridians</hi> with He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie, having nothing to impute to them, but only that he was informed, that they offered a Cake to the honour of the Bleſſed Virgin, which honour yet they might, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out queſtion did give unto her for her relation unto Chriſt,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:57896:243"/>and ſo made her not the laſt object and term of their wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip: and from hence it is evident, that he conceived the very action it ſelf, ſubſtantially and intrinſically malitious, <hi>i. e.</hi> he believed it a ſin that they offered to her at all: and ſo by their action put her in the place of God, by giving unto her this worſhip proper to God; and not that they terminated their action finally in her, or did in very deed think her to be a God, and not a Creature.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But to ſpeak properly,</hi> you ſay, <hi>nothing is offered to her or to her honour, but to God in honour of the Bleſſed Virgin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Belike then if through <hi>Henly</hi> I go from hence to <hi>London,</hi> I may not be ſaid properly to go to <hi>Henly,</hi> but only to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don:</hi> or if through Water I ſee the Sand, I may not be properly ſaid to ſee the Water, but only the Sand. Away with ſuch ſhifting Sophiſtry; either leave your practice of offering to Saints if it be naught, or colour it not over with ſuch empty diſtinctions if it be good: Chriſt ſaith to his Apoſtles in regard of their relation to him, <hi>He that heareth you heareth me, and he that deſpiſeth you deſpiſeth me:</hi> and yet who doubts, but they that heard the Apoſtles did properly hear them, and they that deſpiſed them did properly deſpiſe them, though their action ſtaid not in them, but reached up to Heaven and to Chriſt himſelf. You pray to Saints and Angels, though you do not terminate your prayers in them; and yet I doubt not but your prayers to Saints, may be as properly called prayers, as thoſe you make to God himſelf. For though theſe be of a more excellent na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture than they, yet do they agree in the general na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that they are both prayers. As though a Man be a more excellent living creature than a horſe, yet he agrees with him in this, that both are living creatures. But if nothing be properly offered to her or to her honor, why do you in your ſixth Anſwer ſay, you may offer any thing to the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> by way of preſents and gifts by the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church? Certainly he that offers by way of gift or preſent, offers as properly as he that offers by way of ſacrifice; as a horſe is as properly a living crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as a Man.</p>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:57896:243"/>
                  <p>But if it were ſo as you ſay (which is moſt falſe) that you did not properly offer to the Bleſſed Virgin, but to God in honour of her; yet in my judgment, this would not qualifie or mend the matter but make it worſe. For firſt, who taught you, that in the time of the Goſpel (after the accompliſhment of the prediction, <hi>ſacrifice and offering thou wouldeſt not but a body haſt thou prepared me:</hi> after this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of it in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews, He ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth away the firſt that he may eſtabliſh the ſecond</hi>) that it is ſtill lawful to offer Tapers or Incenſe to God. Secondly, in my underſtanding, to offer to God in honour of the Virgin, is more derogatory from Gods honour, than to offer to her in the honour of God. For this is in my ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion to ſubordinate God to her, to make her the terminating and final object of the action; to make God the way and her the end, and by and through God to conveigh the worſhip unto her.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But for incenſe,</hi> you ſay, <hi>it is a foul ſlander, that it is offered any way to the Bleſſed Virgin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this I anſwer, that your imputing ſlander to me, is it ſelf a ſlander: For 1. In your 5th Anſwer, you have given a clear intimation that you have never been out of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi> ſo that you cannot certainly know, what is the practice of your Church in this point beyond Sea. And he that lives amongſt you, and has but half an Eye open and free from prejudice, cannot but ſee, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion is much more exorbitant in the general practice of it, than it is in the Doctrine publiſhed in Books of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie; where it is delivered with much caution and moderation, nay cunning and diſſimulation that it may be the fitter to win and engage Proſelytes; who being once enſnared, though they be afterwards ſtartled with ſtrange and unlookt-for practices, yet a hundred to one, but they will rather ſtifle their Conſcience, and daſh all ſcruples againſt the pretended Rock of their Churches Infallibility, and blindly follow thoſe guides, to whoſe Conduct they have unadviſedly committed themſelves, than come off again with the ſhame of being reputed weak and inconſtant: ſo terrible an Idol is this vain no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, <hi>the opinion and cenſure of fooliſh men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:57896:244"/>
                  <p>But to return again to you, I ſay your ignorance of the practice of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church beyond the Seas, does plainly convince that you have raſhly and therefore ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derouſly charged me with the Crime of ſlander. As for your reaſon you add, conſider it again, and you will ſee it is worth nothing. For what if incenſing in time of Maſs, be underſtood by all ſorts of People to be directed to God alone (which yet you cannot poſſibly know) yet this I hope hinders not, but that in Proceſſions, you may Incenſe the Images of the Saints, and conſequently (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your Doctrine) do this Honour to the Saints themſelves repreſented by the Images. I my ſelf (unleſs I am very much miſtaken) was preſent when this very thing was done to the Picture of Saint <hi>Benet</hi> or Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> in the Cloyſter of Saint <hi>Veduſtus</hi> in the Monaſtery in <hi>Doway.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But indeed what a ridiculous inconſequence is it, to think that Wax Tapers may lawfully be offered to the Saints and incenſe may not: or if Incenſe may not, which you ſeem to diſclaim as impious, that Wax Tapers may.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Reply.</hi> It ſeems then theſe Women might offer this Cake to the honour and name of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> if they had done it as a <hi>Gift</hi> or <hi>Preſent</hi> and not as a <hi>Sacrifice. Epiphanius</hi> then ſurely was too haſty to condemn them, being informed of nothing, but that they offered a Cake unto her. Methinks before he had put them in his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue, he ſhould have enquired whether they offered this Cake as a <hi>Gift</hi> only, or as a <hi>Sacrifice.</hi> Certainly had the practice of offering to Saints by way of gifts, been the practice of the Church in his time, he would not have been ſo uncharitable, as to condemn that action as impious and Heretical, which might have received ſo lawful and pious a conſtruction. But he, good man, it ſeems could not conceive a difference between a Sacrifice, and the offering a Creature by way of Conſumption to the Honour of that to which it is offered. The ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Wits of our times I hope have found out another de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition for it, and I ſhall underſtand by you what it is. But if you can find no other, then certainly, though ſetting up a Picture or hanging up a Leg or Eye or Ear in memory of ſome miraculous cure, obtained by a Saints interceſſion, would be a <hi>Gift</hi> or <hi>Preſent</hi> only; yet offering of Incenſe, or burning a Taper in the honour of a Saint, daub the matter how you will, will be without Queſtion a <hi>Sacrifice.</hi> If you ſay, that there may be ſuch an offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and yet no Sacrifice; I would know then, how you would prove that the <hi>Collyridians</hi> offering was indeed a Sacrifice? All that <hi>Epiphanius</hi> ſays of them is but this — <hi>Panem proponunt &amp; in Mariae nomen offerunt.</hi> And though
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:57896:245"/>this offering of theirs was indeed a Sacrifice in the notion of the word which I have given it, yet doth he not any where ſay expreſly, <hi>That they did Sacrifice, or offer it as a Sacrifice,</hi> but only and barely that they did <hi>offer it:</hi> not uſing (as good fortune would have it) any word which doth of neceſſity and properly ſignifie <hi>to Sacrifice:</hi> and therefore you are fain to help the Dice, and alter every place for your advantage. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> ſays not, as you tranſlate him, <hi>ut in nomen Virginis Collyridem quendam Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificent;</hi> nor <hi>Sacrificantes offerunt,</hi> as <hi>Petavius:</hi> but <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, which may as well ſignifie, to <hi>conſecrate</hi> or <hi>offer,</hi> as to <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> if there be any difference between them. So the next place, <hi>offerunt panem in nomen Mariae, omnes autem pane participant;</hi> proves not I hope offering by way of <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> unleſs the Conſumption of the oblation make it a <hi>Sacrifice;</hi> which if it do, how your Tapers can be kept from being Sacrifices I cannot imagine; unleſs again perhaps Conſumption by way of <hi>Eating</hi> will make it a <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> and by <hi>Burning</hi> will not; which cannot be, becauſe the whole Burnt-offerings were Sacrifices as well as any other.</p>
                  <p>Your third place is, <hi>Deo autem ab aeterno nullatenus mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier Sacrificavit.</hi> But <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> ſignifies not <hi>to Sacrifice,</hi> but only to <hi>perform the Office of a Prieſt,</hi> and ſo <hi>Petavius</hi> tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlates the place. <hi>Nunquam ſacerdotio functa eſt mulier.</hi> And though Sacrificing be <hi>one</hi> perhaps, yet will you not ſay it is the <hi>only</hi> Office of a Prieſt: as your next and laſt place would have declared, had you ſet it down faithfully; but in that alſo you juggle again, and force it to ſpeak to your purpoſe thus. <hi>Diaconiſſarum ordo eſt in Eccleſia, ſed non ad Sacrificandum:</hi> but <hi>Petavius</hi> hath tranſlated it truly thus: <hi>Quanquam vero Diaconiſſarum in Eccleſia ordo ſit, non tamen ad ſacerdotii functionem, aut ullam adminiſtrationem inſtitutus eſt.</hi> And now though by an uſual Synechdoche the name of the <hi>Genus</hi> be given to the <hi>Species,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had a man fairly and candidly tranſlated <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> by <hi>Sacrifico,</hi> I ſhould not have much condemned him, yet to do it when the Queſtion is, whether this their offering, confeſſed to be an offering, were in propriety of ſpeech
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:57896:245"/>a Sacrifice, to do it for Ends, to ſhift off a convincing ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, to palliate over a foul matter, by putting a verbal difference where there is none indeed, and all that you may, <hi>Imperitos rerum in fraudem illicere;</hi> that is — But I forbear you.</p>
                  <p>But Secondly it is pretended, [<hi>they offered this Sacrifice</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>in the name of the Bleſſed Virgin:</hi> i. e. <hi>unto her, her ſelf, directly and terminately as an act of Divine Worſhip and adoration due unto her, as unto a Sovereign Power and Deity.</hi>] And to colour and countenance this ſtrange gloſs, many places are quoted out of <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> which I will examine in order as they lie.</p>
                  <p>The firſt place is, <hi>mortuis cultum Divinum praeſtantes,</hi> where your meaning is, I believe, that <hi>Epiphanius</hi> ſays the <hi>Collyridians</hi> did ſo: but the truth is he ſays only, <hi>mortuos colentes;</hi> as <hi>Petavius</hi> tranſlates it: and therefore here once again you help the Dice; yet if he had ſaid ſo, why ſhould you rather from <hi>cultum divinum</hi> collect that, that they thought her <hi>God,</hi> than from <hi>mortuis,</hi> that they thought her <hi>Dead,</hi> and therefore certainly not a God? Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this can be no warrant to you, that <hi>Epiphanius</hi> charges them with ſo thinking: For <hi>Proteſtants</hi> you know impute to <hi>Papiſts</hi> that they give to Saints <hi>cultum divinum,</hi> and yet they do not impute to them the Hereſie of thinking, that the Saints are Sovereign Powers and Deities: But as S. <hi>Paul</hi> accuſeth the Gentiles, for that knowing God to be God, <hi>they did not worſhip him as God,</hi> ſo on the other ſide, <hi>Proteſtants</hi> condemn <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and <hi>Epiphanius</hi> for ought we can ſee hitherto, might condemn the <hi>Collyridians,</hi> for that knowing the Bleſſed Virgin not to be God, they yet worſhip'd her as God. That is, gave her that worſhip which is Gods own peculiar, which yet they might do, not becauſe they thought her God, but becauſe this wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, which was indeed proper to God, they might think not proper, but communicable to ſuch Creatures as were high in his favour.</p>
                  <p>The next place is — <hi>Revera virgo erat honorata, ſed non ad adorationem nobis data, ſed ipſa adorans Deum,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:57896:246"/>
                  <p>I anſwer that the <hi>&amp;c.</hi> perhaps conceals ſomething more pertinent to your purpoſe, but in the Words ſet down there appears to me juſt nothing; for I can frame out of them no other Syllogiſm but this.</p>
                  <p>Whatſoever <hi>Epiphanius</hi> in this place ſays is not to be adored, that the <hi>Collyridians</hi> thought to be God.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Epiphan.</hi> here ſays the Virgin is not to be adored.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ergo.</hi> The <hi>Collyridians</hi> thought her God.</p>
                  <p>Of this Syllogiſm I deny the Major propoſition, and I believe ſhall ſtay as long for a proof of it, as I have done for an anſwer to ſome other diſcourſes, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing written in a few days, have waited now with a long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing expectation for a promiſed anſwer many months. If you ſay, you would conclude from theſe Words, that they did adore her and therefore thought her God, I have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered already, that they might do this, not becauſe they thought her God, but becauſe they thought Creatures high in Gods favour capable of adoration.</p>
                  <p>The next place — <hi>Non ut adoretur Virgo, nec ut deum hanc efficeret</hi> — tells us that Chriſt took Fleſh of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, not that ſhe ſhould be adored, nor to make her God: And this you think imports, that they conceive her God. Yet if I ſhould, condemning your Practice of offering Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers to her, uſe the ſame Words and ſay, — <hi>Chriſt took Fleſh of the Virgin, not that ſhe ſhould be adored, or to make her God:</hi> You would not yet conceive that I charged you with the Hereſie of believing her God, but only of the impiety of giving to her that worſhip which was peculiar to God: and why then might not <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> having like occaſion, uſe the ſame words to the <hi>Collyridians</hi> upon the ſame, and no other ground.</p>
                  <p>The next place — <hi>Mariam nemo adoret, Deo debetur hcc myſterium,</hi> — is ſo far from proving your imagination, that it ſtrongly confirms my aſſertion, that <hi>Epiphanius</hi> did not impute to the <hi>Collyridians</hi> the opinion, <hi>that the Virgin</hi> Mary <hi>was God.</hi> If I ſhould ſay to a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> the Bleſſed Virgin is not to be worſhiped with the worſhip of <hi>Hyperdau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,</hi> becauſe ſuch worſhip is due only to the Mother of God, would they not ſay I were mad and argued againſt
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:57896:246"/>my ſelf, for that they believed ſhe was the Mother of God. By like reaſon, if <hi>Epiphanius</hi> knew, that the <hi>Collyridians</hi> believed the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> to be God, he reaſoned as wild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt himſelf in ſaying — <hi>Mariam nemo adoret, Deo debetur hoc myſterium</hi> — For it is very true (might they have ſaid) this ſervice is due to God alone, but you know our Belief and Profeſſion that ſhe is God, and therefore by your own rule capable of this worſhip.</p>
                  <p>The next place is — <hi>Pro Deo hanc introducere ſtudue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt.</hi> And may not this be juſtly ſaid to any man, who to any thing beſides God, gives that worſhip which is proper and peculiar unto God? What if to man that ſhould teach — <hi>The</hi> Pope <hi>had power to diſpenſe with men for the keeping of Gods Laws</hi> — I ſhould ſay, <hi>pro Deo Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pam introducis.</hi> Muſt I of neceſſity mean that that man did verily believe the <hi>Pope</hi> not a man but a Sovereign Power and Deity? S. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us that <hi>Covetouſneſs is Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry;</hi> he tells us of ſome, <hi>whoſe God is their Belly;</hi> is it therefore conſequent, that every covetous man doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed believe his <hi>Gold,</hi> and every Glutton his <hi>Belly,</hi> to be indeed a Sovereign Power and Deity? Away with ſuch fopperies. Whoſoever loves, or fears, or truſts in any thing more than God, may yet be juſtly ſaid to make that his God, and whoſoever ſhould worſhip any Creature with that external worſhip which God has appropriated to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, might juſtly be ſaid to bring in that Creature for God. S. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us of ſome, who <hi>in words profeſſed God,</hi> yet <hi>fact is negabant, in their deeds deny him:</hi> ſo theſe on the contrary, may in their words deny this Creature to be God, and in their Hearts not think it ſo, yet ſeeing their actions to it are as if it were God, they may be juſtly charged, that with their deeds they make this Creature God.</p>

                  </q>
                  <p>What if upon conſideration of the ſtrangely enormous worſhip which <hi>Papiſts</hi> give to the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> (ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by her name, making Vows unto her, offering Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers to her Honour, attributing a kind of Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:57896:247"/>omniſcience and almoſt omnipotence to her, as I can eaſily make good they do, partly out of the Offices of their Church, partly out of private mens Works, but ſet out with Licence and approbation) what I ſay, if upon this conſideration I ſhould affirm, <hi>pro Deo ipſam introducere conantur.</hi> Would it therefore be conſequent, that I muſt impute this Blaſphemy to them, that they believed and taught her to be a Sovereign Power and Deity? I trow not. And therefore <hi>Epiphanius</hi> might ſay the ſame of the <hi>Collyridians</hi> conſidering their <hi>Action,</hi> without any intent of imputing to them any ſuch <hi>opinion.</hi> This <hi>Petavius</hi> ſure ſaw well enough, and therefore (as I ſhall hereafter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate to the Eye) to countenance his Marginal An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notation, <hi>Quidam Mariam Deum eſſe crediderunt,</hi> he cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly abuſes and perverts <hi>Epiphanius</hi> his Text with falſe Tranſlation. — <hi>Sic pugnat, Sic eſt metuendus Ulyſſes.</hi> — The next place is, <hi>revera ſanctum erat</hi> Mariae <hi>corpus non tamen Deus. (The Body of</hi> Mary <hi>was truly holy, but not a God.)</hi> As much to the purpoſe as — <hi>Tityre tu patulae</hi> — for what if <hi>Epiphanius</hi> ſay, ſhe is not God, and therefore not to be adored, does it therefore follow that the <hi>Collyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> believed ſhe was a God? He that knows Logick or ſenſe, cannot but know, that he that will confute an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries concluſion, muſt chooſe ſuch principles to do it, to which his Adverſary conſents, and out of that which he grants prove that which he denies; or if his firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions be not agreed to by his Adverſary, he muſt prove them in the end by ſuch as are agreed to; or elſe he does nothing. And therefore ſeeing <hi>Epiphanius</hi> thinks it ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for the convincing of the <hi>Collyridians,</hi> of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfulneſs of the practice, to ſay, ſhe was not God: it is evident, that ſo far was he from imputing to them the belief that ſhe was God, that he ſeems rather to take the contrary for a principle agreed upon between them, which it was ſufficient to ſay and ſuperfluous to prove. This anſwer I thought good to make, while I conceived that here <hi>Epiphanius</hi> had denied the Perſon of the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> to be God; but after upon better conſideration I found that <hi>Petavius</hi> had abuſed me with adding to <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius</hi>
                     <pb n="53" facs="tcp:57896:247"/>of his own — <hi>Illa fuit</hi> — and that <hi>Epiphanius</hi> ſays not here, <hi>non tamen Deus (ſhe was not God)</hi> of her <hi>Perſon,</hi> but of her <hi>Body;</hi> and as yet I do not underſtand that you impute to the <hi>Collyridians</hi> the belief, that her Body was God.</p>
                  <p>The next place — <hi>Mulierem eam appellavit,</hi> &amp;c. — ſays no more but this; that our Saviour calls the Bleſſed Virgin <hi>Woman,</hi> that no man might think her any thing more than a Woman, as it were prophetically refuting the Schiſms and Hereſies which would be in the World: leſt ſome out of exceſs of admiration of her, might fall into the Dotage of this Hereſie. Thus far <hi>Epiphanius:</hi> but then the Queſtion will be, what was this Hereſie. You ſay the belief that ſhe was God. I ſay, not that ſhe was God, but that they might lawfully offer to her. And as I deny not but it follows, <hi>ſhe is a Woman, therefore not a God;</hi> ſo I think you will grant it follows as juſtly, <hi>ſhe is a Woman, therefore not to be adored with offerings.</hi> And therefore ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the words lie indifferently between us, and are not expreſly and eſpecially here applied, for the refutation of that Hereſie which you pretend they were guilty of, I ſee no reaſon why <hi>Epiphanius</hi> might not as well intend them for that purpoſe which I conceive, as for that which you conceive.</p>
                  <p>The laſt place alledged tells us, <hi>that ſhe was begotten and Born as other Men and Women are.</hi> Which if the <hi>Collyridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> had thought her God, Eternal and abſolutely without beginning, ſhould not have been barely ſaid but proved, as being in effect the very point in queſtion; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſeeing <hi>Epiphanius</hi> contents himſelf with ſaying ſo without proof, it is evident he never thought they would make difficulty to grant it, and conſequently that they did not believe her to be God Eternal.</p>
                  <p>But then again, if the Rule be good which part of your proofs depend upon, That whatever <hi>Epiphanius</hi> denies in this diſcourſe, that the <hi>Collyridians</hi> held (for upon that ground from — <hi>Non &amp; Deum hanc efficeret: &amp; non ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men Deus,</hi> you conclude they believed her God) If I ſay this Rule be good, then you ſhould be conſtant to it,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:57896:248"/>and now that he ſays, — <hi>Non tamen aliter genita eſt prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hominum naturam, (ſhe was not begotten in a different way from other men)</hi> you ſhould infer, that they believed not that ſhe was God, but that ſhe was otherwiſe Born and Begotten than the ordinary ſort of Men. And ſo where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he ſays before — <hi>Non tamen corpus de coelo tulit — (her Body was not from Heaven)</hi> you ſhould infer, that they believed her Body came from Heaven. And again from thoſe — <hi>Sanctum erat Mariae corpus non tamen Deus</hi> — you ſhould collect that they thought not only her perſon, but her Body to be God: or if theſe be wild and weak deductions, then you muſt acknowledge that I have done yours ſome favour in vouchſafing them a particular anſwer.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>Demand.</hi> Whether in the Church of <hi>Roman,</hi> it be not an approved and perpetually practiſed worſhip of the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Virgin, that Incenſe (which was never anciently offered unto any, either by <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Gentiles,</hi> but to the true, or to a ſuppoſed true God) and Tapers and divers other oblations, ſhould be offered to her honour?</p>
                  <p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Reply.</hi> I do not deny, but a practice may be <hi>tolerated</hi> in a Church, and not <hi>approved.</hi> As the <hi>Publick Stews</hi> are in <hi>Italy,</hi> and <hi>Uſury</hi> in <hi>England:</hi> But it is one thing to To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerate with condemnation, another to Tolerate without condemnation, nay with condemnation of thoſe that ſhould oppoſe or condemn it. And ſuch I doubt not upon examination, you may find is this practice, general in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> offering Tapers to the Saints and for their honour. I ſay, not only to God, at the Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the Saints, as you would mince the matter, which yet were a groundleſs ſuperſtition, (God having appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no ſuch Sacrifice to be offered to him under the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel) but to the Saints themſelves and to their honour, prove this lawful for either of thoſe purpoſes you mention, either to procure their interceſſion or as Monuments of thankfulneſs for benefits obtained by it, and then you ſhall do ſomething. Otherwiſe you will but trifle as now you have done: For inſtead of telling us what may be done <hi>de jure,</hi> you tell us what of Old has been done <hi>de facto.</hi> As if <hi>ab antiquo,</hi> and a <hi>principio</hi> were all one; or as if the Church (as we pretend) being ſubject to corruption, part of this corruption might not poſſibly have come in S. <hi>Auſtins</hi> or <hi>Theodorets</hi> time; yet this I ſay not, as if I would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline the Tryal of this cauſe by S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> or <hi>Theodoret;</hi> but becauſe I am ſure you will not be Tryed by the Fathers, no not the conſent of Fathers in all things: and therefore there is no reaſon nor equity in the World, that you ſhould ſerve your ſelves with their Authority in any thing.</p>
                  <p>But now what is it, which was done in S. <hi>Auſtins</hi> time, that may juſtifie the Practice of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church? was there then any approved offering of Wax, Tapers and Incenſe, to the Queen of Heaven or any other Saint? <hi>nil horum:</hi> you neither do nor can produce any thing out of S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> to this purpoſe. But what then is it? Why
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:57896:249"/>forſooth, they were uſed to adorn their Tombs: <hi>Egre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giam verò laudem &amp; ſpolia ampla;</hi> of Old in S. <hi>Auſtins</hi> time they were uſed to adorn their Tombs with Flowers, therefore we may offer Tapers to them. Truly an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent <hi>Enthymeme,</hi> but I fear the concealed propoſition which ſhould make it a <hi>Syllogiſm,</hi> hides its head for ſhame and dares not appear: yet we will for once make bold to draw it forth into light, that you may look upon it and tell us how you like it. This therefore it is.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Whoſe ſoever Tombs we adorn, to them and to their honour we may offer Wax Tapers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Conſider it I pray you, and if you approve it, then approve alſo of offering Tapers not only to Canonize Saints, but to all Chriſtians that may have Monuments in Churches. For all their Tombs may be adorned, with more pretious and laſting Ornaments than Flowers; yet if you had proved but this only, that in S. <hi>Auſtins</hi> time, they adorned the Saints Tombs with Flowers by theſe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſigns to procure their Interceſſion; this, though not much to the purpoſe, had been not abſolutely to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude us. But your quoted places prove not ſo much as this; and yet I believe you quoted the beſt you could find. Nay they prove not they did adorn their Tombs with Flowers at all, much leſs that they did it for your pretended purpoſe; ſuch fools you think to deal with, that will take any thing for any thing. Your firſt place, I ſay, proves it not, unleſs out of meer courteſie we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand by <hi>ferebat, ſhe brought to adorn S.</hi> Stephens <hi>Tomb.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Second proves it not, unleſs we give you leave after <hi>Altari</hi> (without warrant from S. <hi>Auſtin</hi>) to put in, S. <hi>Stephani,</hi> whereas I am yet to ſeek for any place in S. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> where he calls any Altar, the Altar of ſuch or ſuch a Saint, which yet I think they forbore not for the unlawfulneſs, but for fear of miſconſtruction.</p>
                  <p>Then for <hi>Theodoret,</hi> he tells us indeed of Vows made, of monuments of thankfulneſs dedicated, for benefits ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by the interceſſion of the Martyrs. But here alſo I fear your Conſcience tells you, that you abuſe us and hide your ſelf in ambiguities. For to whom does <hi>Theodoret</hi>
                     <pb n="57" facs="tcp:57896:249"/>ſay theſe Vows were made? to whom were theſe monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of thankfulneſs dedicated? What, to the Author? or Procures of the received favours? To God, or to the Martyrs? If to the Martyrs, that had been ſomething to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, though not home to your purpoſe: For there is a a wide difference between offering of a Creature by way of Conſumption (as was never lawfully done but to God alone, as a profeſſion that he is the Lord of the Creature) and erecting a permanent Monument to a Saints honour; which I doubt not but it may lawfully be done to a living Saint, much more to the memory of a Martyr. But <hi>Theodoret</hi> in the place, hath not ſo much as this: Nay it is evident that theſe gifts he ſpeaks of, were both Vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and payed to God himſelf. His words are — <hi>Piè precatos ea conſequi,</hi> &amp;c. — that they which pray piouſly, obtain the things which they deſire, they paying of their Vowed preſents in the ſign of their recovered health, doth abundantly teſtifie. For their Lord accepts moſt gratiouſly theſe preſents how mean ſo ever.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. <hi>Demand.</hi> Whether according to the Doctrine of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, this may not be done lawfully by Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Children, and men that are not Prieſts?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> They may offer any thing by way of <hi>gifts</hi> and <hi>preſents,</hi> by the Doctrine of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church; But it is contrary to the <hi>Roman</hi> Doctrine, for any other than Prieſts, to offer any thing by way of <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> as the <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyridians</hi> did.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reply. Ariſtotle</hi> ſays moſt truly, that true Definitions (he means I think of the terms of the concluſion to be demonſtrated) are the beſt principles of Science: and therefore want of them, muſt needs be a cauſe of Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror and confuſion in any diſcourſe. Let me therefore here requeſt you to ſet down what is a <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> and how diſtinguiſhed from an oblation by way of <hi>gift</hi> or <hi>preſent,</hi> and you will quickly ſee, that if the <hi>Collyridians</hi> offering a Cake to the Bleſſed Virgin were indeed a <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> your offering a Taper to her, muſt likewiſe be ſo. For a <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice</hi> is nothing elſe (for ought I know) but the oblation of any Creature by way of <hi>Conſumption,</hi> to the honour
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:57896:250"/>of that, whatſoever it is, to which it is offered. For if you include in the definition, that this offering muſt be intended to the higheſt Lord of all: So is, as you pretend, your offering of Tapers to the Bleſſed Virgin, intended to God finally, though not immediately. If you ſay it muſt be directed immediatly to him; and is, not only <hi>no law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Sacrifice,</hi> but ſimply <hi>no Sacrifice</hi> unleſs it be ſo: I ſay you may as well require to the eſſence of a Sacrifice, that it be offered by a Prieſt, and from thence conclude, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the <hi>Collyridians</hi> were, you ſay, no Prieſts, their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering was no Sacrifice. For the object of the Action is as extrinſecal to the eſſence of it, as the efficient; And therefore if the defect of a due and legitimate Offerer, cannot hinder but that an offering may be a true Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, neither will the want of a due and lawful object be any hindrance but ſtill it may be ſo. Secondly, I ſay, this is to confound the eſſence of things with the lawful uſe of them; in effect as if you ſhould ſay, that a Knife, if miſimployed, were a Knife no longer. Thirdly, it is to make it not unlawful, to offer Incenſe (which yet you ſeem ſomewhat ſcrupulous of) or Burnt-offerings to the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> or the Saints, or even to living Men, provided you know and believe and profeſs them to be Men and not Gods. For this once ſuppoſed, theſe offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings will be no longer Sacrifices, and to offer to Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures offerings that are not Sacrifices, you ſay, by the Doctrine of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church is lawful: It is laſtly, to deny (which is moſt ridiculous) that the <hi>Pagans</hi> did indeed Sacrifice to any of their inferiour Gods.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. <hi>Demand.</hi> If it be ſaid, that this worſhip which they give to the Bleſſed Virgin is not that of <hi>Latria,</hi> but that of <hi>Dulia</hi> or <hi>Hyperdulia,</hi> for that they do not eſteem her God: or if it be ſaid, that their worſhip to her is not finally terminated neither, but given her for her relation to Chriſt. I demand, whether as it is, in S. <hi>Pauls</hi> judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, a great crime for him that knows God, not to worſhip him as God, ſo it be not as great a crime, for him that knows her not to be God, yet to worſhip her (as if ſhe were God) with the worſhip which is proper

That to my laſt and moſt convincing reaſon, you have anſwered (as much as you could I believe, but yet you have anſwered) no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; and I am well content you ſhould do ſo; for where nothing is to be had, the King himſelf muſt loſe his right. 2. That if I had thought or ſpoke better of the <hi>Collyridians</hi> than they deſerved, yet I cannot ſee how this had been to ſlander the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> 3. That I did not poſitively affirm, that the <hi>Collyridians</hi> might do ſo, but deſired only it might be inquired into and examined,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:57896:251"/>whether for the reaſons alledged they might not do ſo. 4. And laſtly, upon a thorow examination of the matter, I do now affirm, what before I did not, that the <hi>Collyridians</hi> for ought appears to the contrary, might juſtly and truly have ſaid for the juſtification of their practice, as much, nay the very ſame things that the <hi>Papiſts</hi> do for theirs. For they might have ſaid, we are Chriſtians and believe the Scripture, and believe there is but one God. We offer not to the Bleſſed Virgin, as believing ſhe is God, but the Mother of God: our worſhip of her is not abſolute but relative, not terminated in her, but given to her for her Sons ſake: And if our practice may be allowed, we are content to call our Oblation, not a Sacrifice, but a preſent: neither is there any reaſon, why it ſhould be called a Sacrifice, more than the Offering and Burning a Taper to the honour of the ſame Virgin. All this the <hi>Collyridians</hi> might have ſaid for themſelves: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I believe, you will have more cauſe to repent you for daubing over impiety with untempered Morter, than I ſhall have for ſlandering the <hi>Roman</hi> Church with a matter of truth.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. <hi>Demand.</hi> Whether therefore, one of the two muſt not of neceſſity follow: that either the Ancient Church Erred in condemning the Opinion and Practice of the <hi>Collyridians</hi> as Heretical, or elſe that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> Errs, in approving the ſame opinion, and the ſame pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice in effect, which in them was condemned. That is, whether the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> muſt not be Heretical with the <hi>Collyridians,</hi> or elſe the <hi>Collyridians</hi> Catholicks with the Church of <hi>Rome?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> It appears by the former anſwers, that neither did the Ancient Church Err, in condemning the opinion and practice of the <hi>Collyridians,</hi> as Heretical, nor doth the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> approve the ſame opinion or the ſame practice.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reply.</hi> The Subſtance of the former anſwers is but this. That the <hi>Papiſts</hi> offer to the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> and other Saints Wax Tapers by way of <hi>gift</hi> or <hi>preſent,</hi> not of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice; and to her not as to a God, but as the Mother of
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:57896:251"/>God: but that the <hi>Collyridians</hi> offered to her by way of Sacrifice, as to a Sovereign Power and Deity. To this I have replied and proved, that it no way appears, that the <hi>Collyridians</hi> did believe the Bleſſed Virgin to be a Sovereign Power and Deity, or that ſhe was not ſubordinate to God. Then that their offering might be called a <hi>gift,</hi> as well as the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and the <hi>Papiſts</hi> a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> as well as theirs; both of them being a <hi>Conſumption</hi> of a Creature in hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of the Bleſſed Virgin, and neither of them more than ſo: and therefore either the <hi>Collyridians</hi> muſt ſtand with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> or the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> fall with the <hi>Collyridians.</hi> It had been perhaps ſufficient for me, thus to have vindicated my Aſſertion from contrary objections, without taking on my ſelf the burden of proving a Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive: yet to free from all doubt the conformity of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church with the <hi>Collyridians,</hi> in this point, I think it will be neceſſary to ſhew, and that by many very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable Arguments, that <hi>Epiphanius</hi> did not impute to them the pretended Hereſie of <hi>believing</hi> the Virgin <hi>Mary God:</hi> for then that other Evaſion, that their oblation is a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and the <hi>Papiſts</hi> is not, together with this pretence will of it ſelf fall to the ground.</p>
                  <p>Now an opinion may be imputed to a man two ways: either becauſe he holds and maintains it expreſly and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally and in terms: or becauſe it may by a rational de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction be collected from ſome other opinion which he does hold: In this latter ſenſe I deny not but <hi>Epipha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> might impute this opinion we ſpeak of to the <hi>Colly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridians,</hi> as a conſequence upon their practice, which pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice they eſteemed lawful. But that they held it and owned it formally and in terms, this I ſay <hi>Epiphanius</hi> does not impute to them, which I think for theſe ſeven reaſons.</p>
                  <p>My firſt Reaſon is, becauſe he could not juſtly do ſo, and therefore without evident proof we may not ſay he did ſo: for this were to be uncharitable to him, in making him uncharitable to others. Now I ſay he could not juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly charge them with this opinion, becauſe he was not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of any ſuch opinion that they held, but only of
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:57896:252"/>their practice, and this practice was no ſufficient proof that they held this opinion. That his information reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no further than their Practice, appears out of his own Words. <hi>I have heard</hi> (ſaith he. Haereſ. 78.) <hi>another thing with great aſtoniſhment: that ſome being madly affected to the Bleſſed Virgin, endeavour to bring her in in Gods place, being mad and beſides themſelves: For they report that certain Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in</hi> Arabia <hi>have deviſed this Vanity, to have meetings, and offer a Cake to the Bleſſed Virgin:</hi> The ſame practice he ſets down <hi>Haereſ.</hi> 79. But that he was informed of any ſuch opinion that they held, he has not a Word or Sylla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to any ſuch purpoſe; and yet if he had been inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of any, here had been the place to ſet it down: which certainly writing his Book rather of Heretical opinions than practices, he would not have omitted to do; if there had been occaſion: his ſilence therefore is a ſufficient Argument, that he was not informed of any ſuch opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that they held.</p>
                  <p>Now that their practice was no aſſurance that they held this opinion, it is manifeſt; becauſe they might ground it not upon this opinion <hi>that ſhe was God,</hi> but upon another as falſe, though not altogether ſo impious, <hi>That the Worſhip of Oblations was not proper to God alone.</hi> And therefore, though <hi>Epiphanius</hi> might think or fear that poſſibly they might ground their practice upon that other impious opinion, and therefore out of abundant caution confute that alſo, as he doth obliquely and in a word, and once only in all his long diſcourſe, by telling them that our Saviour called her <hi>Woman;</hi> yet he had no ground from their practice to aſſure himſelf, that certainly they did hold ſo. Nay Juſtice and Reaſon and Charity would, that he ſhould incline himſelf to believe, that they ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their practice upon that other opinion, which had leſs impiety in it, that is, that this worſhip of Oblations, was not proper to God, but communicable to Creatures high in his favour.</p>
                  <p>My ſecond is, Becauſe if <hi>Epiphanius</hi> had known, that theſe <hi>Collyridians</hi> held the Bleſſed Virgin to be a Supream Power and Deity; this being a far greater matter than
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:57896:252"/>offering a Cake to her, ſhould in all probability rather have given them their denomination: at leaſt when he ſets down what their Hereſie was, he would have made this part of it, that they did believe ſo: But to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, in his <hi>Anacaephaleoſis,</hi> p. 130. he thus deſcribes them. <hi>They that offer to the name of the Bleſſed Virgin Cakes, who are called</hi> Collyridians. And again, p. 150. <hi>They that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to the Bleſſed Virgin Cakes who are called</hi> Collyridians: So to the 79th. Hereſie he gives this Title, <hi>Againſt the</hi> Collyridians <hi>who offer to</hi> Mary: So <hi>Haereſ.</hi> 78, and 79. He ſets down what he heard of them; but no where that they held this opinion of her: I conclude therefore, that he never conceived this opinion to be a part of their He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie, and they were no further chargeable with it, than as a probable conſequent upon their practice.</p>
                  <p>My third is, Becauſe had the <hi>Collyridians</hi> held her God, they would have worſhiped her all the year long, and not only once a year at a Solemn time, as <hi>Epiphanius</hi> ſays they did.</p>
                  <p>My fourth is, Becauſe if <hi>Epiphanius</hi> had known that they held her God, he would queſtionleſs have urged them with thoſe Attributes that are given to God in Scripture, as Eternity, Immortallity, Impoſſibility, Omnipotence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And ſhewed them, that if they believed the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, they could not think of her any of thoſe things; if they did not, they had no reaſon to think of her any thing more than of an ordinary Woman.</p>
                  <p>My fifth is, becauſe had their opinion been, that the Bleſſed Virgin was God; a great part of <hi>Epiphanius</hi>'s diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe were plainly ridiculous; both where he ſays only without proof, ſhe was not a God but a Mortal Creature, which to them that held the contrary ſhould not have been ſaid, but proved: But eſpecially where he ſpeaks to this purpoſe (as he does very frequently) that the hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of Oblations was not to be given to Angels or Men, much leſs to Women, but only to God: for what had that been to the <hi>Collyridians,</hi> if they thought her (as is pretended) a Sovereign Power and Deity? to what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe was it for <hi>Epiphanius</hi> to ask, <hi>Quis prophetam; What
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:57896:253"/>prophet ever permitted, that a Man, much leſs a Woman ſhould be adored, though he be yet alive. Nor</hi> John <hi>nor</hi> Tecla, <hi>nor any other Saint. For neither ſhall the Old Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition have dominion over us, that leaving the Living God, we ſhould Adore his Creatures.</hi> To what end I ſay was all this, if they thought her not a Saint nor Creature, but God himſelf and the Lord of all? How did this Argument touch them? <hi>Ne Angelos quidem—He ſuffers not the very Angels to be adored, how much leſs the Daughter of</hi> Anna? if they thought her not the Daughter of <hi>Anna,</hi> but God Eternal; In vain had it been to ſay to them — <hi>Not to a Woman, no nor to a Man, but to God alone, is this miſtery</hi> (of Oblation) <hi>due.</hi> So that the Angels themſelves are not fit Subjects for ſuch an honour. Or again, <hi>Let the Creature be turned to the Creator: Let ſhame at length compel you to worſhip God alone:</hi> Or laſtly, that ſo often repeated — <hi>Let</hi> Mary <hi>be honoured, but the Lord only adored.</hi> For they might have anſwered all this in a word, ſaying, All this diſcourſe ſits beſides the Cuſhion, and concerns us and our offering nothing at all. For we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Bleſſed Virgin to whom we offer neither Man nor Woman, nor Angel, nor Creature, but a Deity.</p>
                  <p>A Sixth Reaſon let it be this, If <hi>Epiphanius</hi> did indeed ſay of the <hi>Collyridians</hi> as is pretended, That they held the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> God, and ſo difference their practice from the <hi>Papiſts:</hi> Then the Author of this Anſwer and <hi>Petavius</hi> in his Tranſlation, needed not to have dictated to him what he ſhould ſay, nor make him ſay ſo whether he will or no: But it is evident they do ſo, as of the Author of this Anſwer I have already ſhewn: and for <hi>Petavius</hi> his part, I will ſo preſent it to your view, that if you will not ſhut your Eyes, you ſhall not chooſe but ſee it.</p>
                  <p>Firſt then, <hi>Haereſ.</hi> 78. <hi>propè fin.</hi> he <hi>(Petavius)</hi> ſets in his Margent, <hi>quidam Deum Mariam eſse, crediderunt;</hi> and to countenance this with a <hi>loquuntur</hi> of his own putting in, makes them <hi>ſpeak</hi> of her like mad Men, <hi>i. e.</hi> they ſaid ſhe was God: whereas in <hi>Epiphanius</hi>'s Greek they ſay juſt nothing.</p>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:57896:253"/>
                  <p>Secondly, To faſten the pretended Opinion on them, he tranſlates <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>Novum dogma:</hi> preſuming it ſeems <gap reason="foreign">

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and therefore meanes nothing by it, but a vanity or fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, He tranſlates <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, <hi>Illud;</hi> and ſo makes it look backward to that pretended <hi>Novum dogma</hi> of the <hi>Collyridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;</hi> whereas it ſignifies there [And] and looks forward to their practice.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, With the help of a <hi>Colon,</hi> he ſtops the ſenſe at <hi>Commentas fuiſſe,</hi> whereas in <hi>Epiphanius</hi> there is but a <hi>Comma,</hi> and the ſenſe goes on without ſuſpenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, With an <hi>adeo ut,</hi> he brings in their action, as an effect of their former opinion; whereas <hi>Epiphanius</hi> lays nothing to their charge but their Action only: So that whereas <hi>Epiphanius</hi> his words truly tranſlated run thus: <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother thing I have received with great aſtoniſhment, that others being mad concerning the Bleſſed Virgin, have and do go about to bring her in, in the place of God, being mad, I ſay, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides themſelves: For they report that certain Women in</hi> Arabia <hi>have brought this vanity of offering a Cake to her name. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tavius</hi> makes them thus — <hi>Not without admiration we have heard another thing, that ſome in theſe things that concern the moſt holy Virgin have proceeded to that degree of madneſs, that they would obtrude her upon us for a God, and ſpeak of her as madmen: For they report that certain Women in</hi> Arabia, <hi>have invented that new Opinion: ſo that to the Virgins name and honour, they offer by way of ſacrifice a Cake or wreath of Bread.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again in the ſame <hi>Haereſ.</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, he tranſlates advantageouſly—<hi>per mulieres ſacrificia facere.</hi> Whereas <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> is more general than <hi>ſacrificia facere,</hi> and ſignifies <hi>ſacris operari,</hi> or <hi>ſacros ritus peragere.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again, in the ſame place, whereas <hi>Epiphanius</hi> ſays ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply and abſolutely—<hi>Let no man offer to her name,</hi> he makes it, <hi>Let no man offer ſacrifice to her name;</hi> as if you might law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully offer any thing provided you do not call it a ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</p>
                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:57896:254"/>
                  <p>So again <hi>Haereſ.</hi> 79. beſides his putting cunningly—<hi>ipſa fuit</hi>—which before we took notice of; he makes no ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to put in <hi>Dogma</hi> and <hi>Sacrificium,</hi> whereſoever it may be for his purpoſe. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> his title to this Hereſie is, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the</hi> Collyridians <hi>who offer to</hi> Mary—<hi>Petavius</hi> puts in—<hi>Sacrifice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again in the ſame page, before <hi>D.</hi> he puts in his own <hi>illo dogmate,</hi> and whereas <hi>Epiphanius</hi> ſays—<hi>in all this,</hi> he makes it, <hi>in all this Opinion.</hi>
                  </p>

                     </gap> though perhaps it may ſignifie a <hi>thought,</hi> or act of thinking, yet I believe it never ſignifies an <hi>Opinion</hi> which we hold.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Pag. 1064. at <hi>C. Nor that we ſhould offer to her name,</hi> ſimply and abſolutely: he makes it,—<hi>Nor that we ſhould offer ſacrifice to her name.</hi> So many times is he fain to corrupt, and tranſlate him partially, leſt in condemning the <hi>Collyridians,</hi> he might ſeem to have involved the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the <hi>Roman Church</hi> in the ſame Condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                  <p>My Seventh and laſt Reaſon is this. Had <hi>Epiphanius</hi> known that the <hi>Collyridians</hi> held the <hi>virgin Mary</hi> to be a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign power and Deity, then he could not have doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, whether this their offering was to her or to God for her: whereof yet he ſeems doubtful and not fully reſolved, as his own words intimate, <hi>Haereſ.</hi> 79. <hi>ad fin. Quam multa</hi> &amp;c. <hi>How many things may be objected againſt this Hereſie? for idle Women either worſhipping the Bleſsed Virgin, offer unto her a Cake, or elſe they take upon them to offer for her this fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid ridiculous oblation. Now both are fooliſh and from the Devil.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe Arguments I ſuppoſe do abundantly demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate to any man not viel'd with prejudice, that <hi>Epiphani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> imputed not to the <hi>Collyridians</hi> the Hereſie of believing the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> God: and if they did not think her God, there is then no reaſon imaginable why their oblation of a <hi>Cake,</hi> ſhould not be thought a <hi>Preſent,</hi> as well as the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:57896:254"/>Papiſts offering a <hi>Taper,</hi> or that the Papiſts offering a <hi>Taper,</hi> ſhould not be thought a <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> as well as their offering a <hi>Cake;</hi> and ſeeing this was the difference preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded between them, this being vaniſhed there remains none at all; So that my firſt Concluſion ſtands yet firm; that either the Ancient Church erred in condemning the <hi>Colly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridians,</hi> or the preſent errs in approving and practiſing the ſame worſhip.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>THE Condition without the performance whereof no man can be admitted to the Communion of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> is this; that he believe firmly and without doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, whatſoever the Church requires him to believe: More diſtinctly and particularly thus:</p>
                  <p>He muſt believe all that to be divine Revelation which that Church teaches to be ſuch; as the Doctrin of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, the Hypoſtatical union of two natures in the perſon of Chriſt. The proceſſion of the Holy Ghoſt from the Father and the Son: the Doctrin of Tranſubſtantiation, and ſuch like.</p>
                  <p>Whatſoever that Church teaches to be neceſſary, he muſt believe to be neceſſary. As Baptiſm for Infants; Faith in Chriſt, for thoſe that are Capable of Faith; Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance for thoſe that have committed mortal ſin after Baptiſm, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Whatſoever that Church declares expedient and profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, he muſt believe to be expedient and profitable: as Monaſtical Life: Prayer to Saints: Prayer for the Dead: going on Pilgrimages: The uſe of Pardons: Veneration of holy Images and Reliques: Latin Service where the people underſtand it not: Communicating the Laity in one kind and ſuch like.</p>
                  <p>Whatſoever that Church holdeth lawful, he muſt believe lawful: As to Marry: to make diſtinction of Meats, as if ſome were clean and others unclean: to flie in time of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution: for them that ſerve at the Altar, to live by the Altar: to teſtifie a truth by Oath, when a lawful Magiſtrate ſhall require it: to poſſeſs Riches, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Now is it impoſſible that any man ſhould certainly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve any thing; unleſs either it be evident of it ſelf, or he have ſome certain reaſon (at leaſt ſome ſuppoſed cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain reaſon) and infallible ground for his belief. Now the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:57896:255"/>Doctrins which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> teacheth, it is evident and undeniable that they are not evident of themſelves, neither evidently true nor evidently credible. He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that will believe them, muſt of neceſſity have ſome certain and infallible ground whereon to build his belief of them.</p>
                  <p>There is no other ground for a Mans belief of them, eſpecially in many points, but only an aſſurance of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> No man can be aſſured that that Church is infallible and cannot err, whereof he may be aſſured that ſhe hath erred, unleſs ſhe had ſome new promiſe of divine aſſiſtance, which might for the future ſecure her from danger of erring; but the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> pretends to none ſuch.</p>
                  <p>Nothing is more certain, than that that Church hath erred, which hath believed and taught irreconcileable Contradictions, one whereof muſt of neceſſity be an Error.</p>
                  <p>That the Receiving the Sacrament of the Euchariſt is neceſſary for Infants, and that the receiving thereof is not neceſſary for them: That it is the will of God, that the Church ſhould adminiſter the Sacrament to them; and that it is not the will of God that the Church ſhould do ſo; are manifeſt and irreconcileable Contradictions: Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing only, (that which is moſt evident) that the Euchariſt is the ſame thing, of the ſame vertue and efficacy now, as it was in the primitive Church: That Infants are the ſame things they were, have as much need, are capable of as much benefit by the Euchariſt, now as then: As ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to irreverent carriages, then as now. And laſtly, that the preſent Church is as much bound to provide for the ſpiritual good of Infants, as the Ancient Church was: I ſay theſe things ſuppoſed, the propoſitions before ſet down are plain and irreconcileable Contradictions: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the preſent <hi>Roman</hi> Church doth hold the Negative, and the Ancient Church of <hi>Rome</hi> did hold the Affirmative; and therefore it is evident, that either the preſent Church doth err, in holding ſomething not neceſſary, which is ſo; or that the Ancient Church did err, in holding ſomething neceſſary, which was not ſo.</p>
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:57896:256"/>
                  <p>For the Negative Propoſition, <hi>viz. That the Euchariſt is not neceſſary for Infants;</hi> that it is the Doctrin of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Church of <hi>Rome</hi> it is moſt manifeſt. 1. From the diſuſe and abolition and prohibition of the contrary Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent practice. For if the Church did conceive it neceſſary for them, either ſimply for their ſalvation, or elſe for their increaſe or confirmation in grace, and advancement to a higher degree of glory (unleſs ſhe could ſupply ſome other way their damage in this thing, which evidently ſhe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not) what an uncharitable ſacriledge is it, to debar and defraud them of the neceſſary means of their ſo great ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual benefit? eſpecially ſeeing the adminiſtration of it might be ſo ordered, that irreverent caſualties might eaſily be prevented: which yet ſhould they fall out againſt the Churches and Paſtors intention, certainly could not offend God, and in reaſon ſhould not offend man. Or if the Church do believe, that upon ſuch a vain fear of irreve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence (which we ſee moved not the Ancient Church at all) ſhe may lawfully forbid ſuch a general, perpetual and neceſſary charity, certainly herein ſhe commits a far grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter error than the former. Secondly, from the Council of <hi>Trents</hi> Anathema, denounced on all that hold the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, in theſe words. <hi>If any man ſay that the receiving of the Euchariſt, is neceſſary for little children, before they come to years of diſcretion, let him be Anathema.</hi> Concil. Trid. Seſſ. 21. <hi>de communione parvulorum,</hi> Can. 4.</p>
                  <p>Now for the Affirmative part of the Contradiction, to make it evident that that was the Doctrin of the Ancient Church; I will prove it, Firſt, from the general practice of the Ancient Church for ſeveral Ages. Secondly, by the direct and formal Teſtimonies of the Fathers of thoſe times. Thirdly, by the confeſſion of the moſt learned Antiquaries of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. My Firſt Argument I form thus. If to communicate Infants was the general practice of the Ancient Church for many Ages; then cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the Church then believed, that the Euchariſt was neceſſary for them, and very available for their Spiritual benefit: But it is certain, that the Communicating of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants was the general practice of the Church for many
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:57896:256"/>Ages: Therefore the Church of thoſe times thought it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for them. To deny the conſequence of the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, is to charge the Church with extream folly, wilful ſuperſtition, and perpetual profanation of the Bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament. As for the Aſſumption, it is fully confirmed by <hi>Clemens Rom. Conſtit. Apoſt.</hi> l. 3. c. 20. <hi>Dionyſius Areopagita de Eccleſ. Hierarch.</hi> cap. ult. S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> and a Council of <hi>African</hi> Biſhops with him, <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 59. <hi>ad Fidum;</hi> and in his Treatiſe <hi>de Lapſis</hi> p. 137. Edit. <hi>Pamel.

It was the practice of the Church of the <hi>Armenians</hi> in <hi>Waldenſis</hi> his time, as he relates out of <hi>Guido</hi> the <hi>Carmelite,</hi> Tom. 2. de <hi>Sacr.</hi> c. 91. <hi>de erroribus Armenorum.</hi> It is ſtill in force in the Church of the <hi>Abyſſines,</hi> witneſs <hi>Franc.

Arcudius</hi> lib. 1. c. 14. &amp; lib. 3. c. 40. <hi>de concord. Eccleſ. Orient. &amp; Occident. in Sacram. adminiſtratione; Card. Perron des paſſages de S. Auſtin.</hi> p. 100. where he alſo aſſures us of the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church in general, that ſhe gave Infants the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt as ſoon as they were baptized: and that the cuſtome of giving this Sacrament to little Infants the Church then obſerved: and before p. 21. That in thoſe Ages it was always given to Infants together with Baptiſm. The ſame is likewiſe acknowledged by <hi>Contzen</hi> in <hi>John</hi> 6. <hi>ver.</hi> 54. and by <hi>Thomas a Jeſu de proc. ſalute omnium gentium.</hi> So that this matter of the practice of the Ancient Church is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently cleared. Seeing therefore the Ancient Church did uſe this Cuſtom, and could have no other ground for it,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:57896:257"/>but their belief that this Sacrament was neceſſary for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, it follows neceſſarily, that the Church then did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it neceſſary.</p>
                  <p>But deductions, though never ſo evident, are ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and may be ſet aſide, where there is ſuch abundance of direct and formal Authentical Teſtimonies; whereof ſome ſpeak in <hi>Theſi,</hi> of the neceſſity of the Euchariſt for all men, others in <hi>Hypotheſi,</hi> of the neceſſity of it for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants.</p>
                  <p>My Second Argument, from the Teſtimonies of the Fathers of thoſe times I form thus. That Doctrin, in the affirmative whereof the moſt eminent Fathers of the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Church agree, and which none of their contempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries have oppoſed or condemned, ought to be taken for the Catholick Doctrin of the Church of thoſe times.</p>
                  <p>But the moſt eminent Fathers of the Ancient Church agree in the Affirmation of this Doctrin, that the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt is neceſſary for Infants; and none of their contempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raries have oppoſed or condemned it. <hi>Ergo,</hi> it ought to be taken for the Catholick Doctrin of the Church of their times. The Major of this Syllogiſm is delivered and fully proved by <hi>Card. Perron,</hi> in his Letter to <hi>Caſaubon</hi> 5. obſ. and is indeed ſo reaſonable a poſtulate, that none but a conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious ſpirit can reject it.</p>
                  <p>For confirmation of the Minor, I will alledge, firſt, their ſentences, which in Theſi affirm the Euchariſt to be gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally neceſſary for all, and therefore for Infants: and then their Suffrages, who in Hypotheſi avouch the neceſſity of it for Infants.</p>
                  <p>The moſt pregnant Teſtimonies of the firſt rank are theſe: Of <hi>Iraeneus</hi> lib. 4. <hi>cont. Hereſ.</hi> c. 34. where he makes our Union to Chriſt by the Euchariſt, the foundation of the hope of our reſurrection, in theſe words. <hi>As the bread of Earth, after the Invocation of God, is now not common bread, but the Euchariſt, conſiſting of two things an earthly and an heavenly: ſo our bodies receiving the Euchariſt, are not now corruptible (for ever) but have hope of reſurrection.</hi> The like he hath, <hi>lib.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 2. And hence in probability it is, that the <hi>Nicene Council</hi> ſtiled this Sacrament, <hi>Symbolum re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrectionis,</hi>
                     <pb n="73" facs="tcp:57896:257"/>the pledge of our Reſurrection. And <hi>Ignatius</hi> Ep. ad Eph. <hi>Pharmacum Immortalitatis,</hi> the Medicine of Immortality.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cyril. Alex.</hi> lib. 4. in Joan. <hi>They ſhall never partake, nor ſo much as taſt, the life of holineſs and happineſs, which receive not the Son in the myſtical Benediction. Cyril.</hi> lib. 10. in Joan. c. 13. &amp; lib. 11. c. 27. <hi>This corruptible nature of our body, could not otherwiſe be brought to life and immortality, unleſs this body of natural life were conjoyned unto it.</hi> The very ſame things ſaith <hi>Gregory Nyſſen.</hi> Orat. Catech. c. 37. And that they both ſpeak of our conjunction with Chriſt by the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt, the Antecedents and Conſequents do fully mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, and it is a thing confeſſed by learned Catholicks.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cyprian de coena Domini,</hi> and <hi>Tertullian de reſur. carnis,</hi> ſpeak to the ſame purpoſe: But I have not their Books by me, and therefore cannot ſet down their words. S. <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtom,</hi> Hom. 47. in Joh. on theſe words, <hi>niſi manducave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritis,</hi> has many pregnant and plain ſpeeches to our purpoſe. <hi>As, the words here ſpoken are very terrible: verily, ſaith he, if a man eat not my fleſh, and drink not my blood, he hath no life in him; for whereas they ſaid before, this could not be done, he ſhews it not only not impoſſible, but alſo very neceſſary.</hi> And a little after; <hi>he often iterates his ſpeech concerning the holy my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries, ſhewing the neceſſity of the thing, and that by all means it muſt be done.</hi> And again, <hi>what means that which he ſays, my fleſh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed; either that this is the true meat that ſaves the ſoul; or to confirm them in the faith of what he had ſpoken, that they ſhould not think he ſpoke Enigmatically, or parabolically, but knew that by all means they muſt eat his body.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But moſt clear and unanſwerable is that place <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>de Sacerdotio,</hi> where he ſaith, <hi>If a man cannot enter into the Kingdom of Heaven unleſs he be born again of water and the holy ſpirit; and if he which eats not the fleſh of our Lord and drinks not his blood, is caſt out of eternal life: And all theſe things cannot be done by any other, but only by thoſe holy hands, the hands, I ſay of the Prieſt, how then without their help can any man, either avoid the fire of hell, or obtain the Crowns laid up for us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:57896:258"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Theophylact.</hi> in 6. Joan. <hi>when therefore we hear, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs we eat the fleſh of the Son of man, we cannot have life, we muſt have faith without doubting in the receiving of the divine myſteries, and never inquire how: for the natural man, that is he which followeth humane, that is, natural reaſons, receives not the things which are above nature and ſpiritual; as alſo he underſtands not the ſpiritual meat of the fleſh of our Lord, which they that receive not, ſhall not be partakers of eternal life, as not receiving Jeſus, who is the true life.</hi> S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> de pec. mer. &amp; Remiſ. c. 24. <hi>Very well do the puny Chriſtians call Baptiſm nothing elſe but ſalvation; and the Sacrament of Chriſts Body nothing elſe but Life; from whence ſhould this be, but as I believe from the Ancient and Apoſtolical Tradition, by which this Doctrin is implanted into the Churches of Chriſt, that but by Baptiſm and the participation of the Lords Table, not any man can attain, neither to the Kingdom of God, nor to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation and eternal life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now we are taught by the learned Cardinal; that when the Fathers ſpeak, not as Doctors, but as witneſſes of the Cuſtoms of the Church of their times; and do not ſay, <hi>I believe this ſhould be ſo holden, or ſo underſtood, or ſo obſerved, but that the Church from one end of the earth to the other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves it ſo, or obſerves it ſo;</hi> then we no longer hold what they ſay, for a thing ſaid by them, but as a thing ſaid by the whole Church; and principally when it is in points, whereof they could not be ignorant, either becauſe of the condition of the things, as in matters of fact; or becauſe of the ſufficiency of the perſons: and in this caſe, we ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue no more upon their words probably, as we do when they ſpeak in the quality of particular Doctors, but we ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue thereupon demonſtratively.</p>
                  <p>I ſubſume. But S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> the ſufficienteſt perſon which the Church of his time had, ſpeaking of a point, wherein he could not be ignorant; ſays not that I believe the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt to be neceſſary to ſalvation; but the Churches of Chriſt believe ſo, and have received this doctrin from A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolical Tradition: Therefore I argue upon his words not probably, but demonſtratively, that this was the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick doctrin of the Church of his time. And thus much
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:57896:258"/>for the <hi>Theſis, That the Euchariſt was held generally neceſſary for all.</hi> Now for the <hi>Hypotheſis; That the Euchariſt was held neceſſary for Infants in particular.</hi> Witneſſes hereof are S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> Pope <hi>Innocentius</hi> I. and <hi>Euſebius Emiſſenus,</hi> with S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> together with the Author of the Book intituled <hi>Hypognoſtica.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cyprian</hi> indeed does not in terms affirm it, but we have a very clear intimation of it in his Epiſtle to <hi>Fidus.</hi> For whereas he and a Council of Biſhops together with him, had ordered, that Infants might be <hi>baptized</hi> and <hi>ſacrificed,</hi> that is, <hi>communicated</hi> before the eighth day, though that were the day appointed for Circumciſion by the old Law. There he ſets down this as the reaſon of their Decree, <hi>that the mercy and grace of God, was to be denied to no man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the firſt, (in <hi>Ep. ad Epiſ. Conc. Milev. quae eſt inter Auguſt.</hi> 93.) concludes againſt the <hi>Pelagians;</hi> that Infants could not attain eternal life without Baptiſm; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe without Baptiſm they were uncapable of the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt, and without the Euchariſt could not have eternal life. His words are, <hi>but that which your Fraternity affirms them to Preach, that Infants without the grace of Baptiſm may have the rewards of eternal life, is certainly moſt fooliſh; for unleſs they eat the fleſh of the Son of man and drink his blood; they ſhall have no life in them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now that this ſenſe which I have given his words, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the true ſenſe of them, and that his judgment upon the point was as I have ſaid; it is acknowledged by <hi>Maldonate</hi> in <hi>Joan.</hi> 6. <hi>v.</hi> 54. by <hi>Binius</hi> upon the Councils <hi>Tom.</hi> 1. p. 624. by <hi>Sancteſius, Repet.</hi> 6. c. 7. and it is affirmed by S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> who was his Contemporary, held correſpondence by Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters with him, and therefore in all probability could not be ignorant of his meaning. I ſay he affirms it, as a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter out of Queſtion, Epiſt. 106. and <hi>Cont. Julian.</hi> lib. 1. c. 4. where he tells that <hi>Pelagius</hi> in denying this, did diſpute <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra ſedis Apoſtolicae authoritatem;</hi> againſt the authority of the Sea Apoſtolick; and after, <hi>but if they yield to the Sea Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolick, or rather to the Maſter himſelf and Lord of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, who ſays, that they ſhall not have life in them, unleſs they
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:57896:259"/>eat the fleſh of the Son of man and drink his blood, which none may do but thoſe that are baptized; then at length they will confeſs, that Infants not baptized cannot have life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now I ſuppoſe no man will doubt, but the belief of the Apoſtolick Sea; was then (as S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> aſſures us <hi>l.</hi> 1. <hi>cont. Jul. c.</hi> 4.) the belief of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> taking it for a particular Church: and then it will preſently follow, that either other Churches do not think themſelves bound in conformity of belief with the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding <hi>Irenaeus</hi> his—<hi>neceſſe eſt ad hanc Eccleſiam, omnem convenire Eccleſiam:</hi> or that this was then the Doctrin of the Catholick Church. For <hi>Euſebius Emiſſenus</hi> I cannot quote any particular proof out of him: but his belief in this point is acknowledged by <hi>Sancteſ.</hi> Repet. 6. c. 7. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe for S. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> the ſame <hi>Sancteſius</hi> and <hi>Binius,</hi> and <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donate,</hi> either not mindful or not regardful of the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thema of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> acknowledge (in the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces above quoted) that he was alſo of the ſame belief: and indeed he profeſſeth it ſo plainly and ſo frequently, that he muſt be a meer ſtranger to him that knows it not, and very impudent that denies it. <hi>Euchariſtiam infantibus putet neceſſariam Auguſtinus,</hi> ſay alſo the Divines of <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaine,</hi> in their <hi>Index</hi> to their Edition of S. <hi>Auſtin:</hi> and they refer us in their <hi>Index</hi> only to Tom. 2. pag. 185. that is, to the 106. Epiſt. (the words whereof I have already quoted to ſhew the meaning of <hi>Innocentius</hi>) and to Tom. 7. pag. 282. that is, lib. 1. <hi>de pec.

Neither doth he retract or contradict this opinion any where, nor miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate any one of his ſentences touching this matter, in his Book of <hi>Retractations. Sancteſius</hi> indeed tells us, that he ſeems to have departed from his Opinion, in his works againſt the <hi>Donatiſts.</hi> But I would he had ſhewed ſome probable reaſon to make it ſeem ſo to others; which ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he does not, we have reaſon to take time to believe him. For as touching the place mentioned by <hi>Beda</hi> in 1. <hi>ad Corinth.</hi> 10. as taken out of a Sermon of S. <hi>Auſtins, ad infantes ad Altare.</hi> Beſides that it is very ſtrange S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi> ſhould make a Sermon to Infants; and that there is no ſuch Sermon extant in his works; nor any memory of any ſuch in <hi>Poſſidius,</hi> S. <hi>Auſtins</hi> Scholars Catalogue of his works, nor in his Book of <hi>Retractaitons:</hi> ſetting aſide all this, I ſay Firſt, That it is no way certain that he ſpeaks there of Infants, ſeeing in propriety of ſpeech (as S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi> himſelf teacheth us <hi>Ep.</hi> 23) Infants were not <hi>Fideles,</hi> of whom S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> in that ſuppoſed Sermon ſpeaks. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, Admit he does ſpeak of Infants, where he aſſures us, that in Baptiſm every faithful man is made partaker of Chriſts body and blood, and that he ſhall not be ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enated from the benefit of the Bread and Cup, although he depart this life, before he eat of that Bread and drink of that Cup. All this concludes no more, but that the actual participation of the Euchariſt, is not a means ſimply neceſſary to attain ſalvation, ſo that no impoſſibility ſhall excuſe the failing of it: Whereas all that I aim at is but this, that in the judgment of the Ancient Church, it was believed neceſſary, in caſe of poſſibility; neceſſary, not

                  <p>The third kind of proof, whereby I undertook to ſhew the belief of the ancient Church in this point, was the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the learnedeſt Writers and beſt verſt in the Church of</hi> Rome.

                  <p>The ſame almoſt in terms hath <hi>Binius,</hi> in his Notes on the Councils, pag. 624. <hi>Hinc conſtat Innocentii ſententia (quae ſexcentos circiter annos viguit in Eccleſiâ, quam Auguſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus ſectatus eſt) Euchariſtiam etiam infantibus neceſſariam fuiſſe.</hi>

                  <p>Laſtly, That treaſury of Antiquity Cardinal <hi>Perron,</hi> though he ſpeaks not ſo home as the reſt do, yet he ſays enough for my purpoſe: <hi>des paſſages de S. Auguſt.</hi> c. 10.

                  <p>The Iſſue of all this Diſcourſe, for ought I can ſee, muſt be this: That either both parts of a Contradiction muſt be true, and conſequently nothing can be falſe, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that which contradicteth truth is not ſo: or elſe, that the Ancient Church did err in believing ſomething ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient which was not ſo; (and if ſo, why may not the preſent Church err, in thinking <hi>Latin</hi> Service, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion in one kind expedient:) or that the preſent Church doth err, in thinking ſomething not expedient, which is ſo.

                  <head>V. <hi>An Argument drawn from the Doctrin of the Millenaries, againſt Infallibility.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THE Doctrin of the <hi>Millenaries</hi> was, <hi>That before the worlds end, Chriſt ſhould reign upon earth for a thouſand years, and that the Saints ſhould live under him in all holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and happineſs.</hi> That this Doctrin is by the preſent <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Church held falſe and Heretical, I think no man will deny.</p>
                  <p>That the ſame Doctrin, was by the Church of the next Age after the Apoſtles held true and Catholick I prove by theſe two Reaſons.</p>
                  <p>The firſt Reaſon, Whatſoever doctrin is believed and taught by the moſt eminent Fathers of any Age of the Church, and by none of their contemporaries oppoſed or condemned, that is to be eſteemed the Catholick Doctrin of the Church of thoſe times.</p>
                  <p>But the Doctrin of the <hi>Millenaries</hi> was believed and taught by the eminent Fathers of the Age next after the Apoſtles, and by none of that Age oppoſed or condemned.</p>
                  <p>Therefore it was the Catholick Doctrin of the Church of thoſe times. The Propoſition of this Syllogiſm is Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Perrons</hi> rule, (in his Epiſtle to <hi>Caſaubon,</hi> 5. obſerv.) And is indeed one of the main pillars, upon which the great Fabrick of his Anſwer to King <hi>James</hi> doth ſtand, and with which it cannot but fall; and therefore I will ſpend no time in the proof of it.</p>
                  <p>But the Aſſumption thus I prove.</p>
                  <p>That Doctrin which was believed and taught by <hi>Papias</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Hierapolis,</hi> the diſciple of the Apoſtles diſciples (according to <hi>Euſebius</hi>) who lived in the times of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, ſaith he, by <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> Doctor of the Church and Martyr: by <hi>Melito</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Sardis,</hi> who had the gift of Propheſie, witneſs <hi>Tert.</hi> and whom <hi>Bellarmine</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth a Saint.

<pb n="81" facs="tcp:57896:261"/>Doctor of the Church of thoſe times: That Doctrine was believed and taught by the moſt Eminent Fathers of that Age, next to the Apoſtles, and oppoſed by none.</p>
                  <p>But the former part of the Propoſition is true. <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Latter is alſo true.</p>
                  <p>The Major of this Syllogiſm and the latter part of the Minor, I ſuppoſe will need no proof, with them that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that theſe here mentioned were equal in number to all the other Eccleſiaſtical Writers of that Age, of whom there is any memory remaining; and in weight and worth infinitely beyond them: they were <hi>Athenago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras, Theophilus Antiochenus, Egeſippus</hi> and <hi>Hippolitus:</hi> of whoſe contradiction to this Doctrine there is not extant, neither in their works, nor in ſtory, any Print or Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtep: which if they or any of them had oppoſed, it had been impoſſible, conſidering the Eccleſiaſtical Story of their time is Written by the profeſſed Enemies of the Millinaries Doctrine; who could they have found any thing in the monuments of Antiquity to have put in the Ballance againſt <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> and <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> no doubt would not have buried it in ſilence: which yet they do, neither vouching for their opinion any one of more Antiquity than <hi>Dionyſius Alexandrinus,</hi> who lived, ſaith <hi>Euſebius, noſtra aetate,</hi> [in our Age] but certainly in the latter part of the third Century. For <hi>Tatianus</hi> becauſe an Heretick I reckon not in this number. And if any man ſay that before his fall he wrote many Books; I ſay, it is true; but withal would have it remembred, that he was <hi>Juſtin Martyrs</hi> Scholar, and therefore, in all proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of his Maſters Faith, rather than againſt it, all that is extant of him one way or other is but this in S. <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome, de Script. Eccleſ.</hi> Juſtini Martyris <hi>ſectator fuit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now for the other part of the Minor, that the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Fathers did believe and teach this Doctrine. And firſt for <hi>Papias</hi> that he taught it, it is confeſſed by <hi>Euſebius</hi> the Enemy of this Doctrine (<hi>Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>Hiſt. Eccleſ. c.</hi> 33.) in theſe words, — <hi>Other things beſides the ſame Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor</hi> (Papias) <hi>declares, that they came to him as it were by unwritten Tradition, wherein he affirms that after the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:57896:262"/>of all Fleſh from the Dead, there ſhall be a Kingdom of Chriſt continued and eſtabliſhed for a thouſand years upon Earth, after a humane and corporeal manner.</hi> The ſame is confeſſed by S. <hi>Hierome,</hi> another Enemy to this opinion, (<hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript. Eccleſ. S.</hi> 29.) Papias <hi>the Auditor of</hi> John <hi>Biſhop of</hi> Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropolis <hi>is ſaid to have taught the Judaical Tradition of a thouſand years, whom</hi> Irenaeus <hi>and</hi> Apollinarius <hi>followed.</hi> And in his preface upon the Commentaries of <hi>Victorinus</hi> upon the <hi>Apocalypſe,</hi> thus he writes, — <hi>before him</hi> Papias <hi>Biſhop of</hi> Hieropolis <hi>and</hi> Nepos <hi>Biſhop in the parts of</hi> Egypt <hi>taught as</hi> Victorinus <hi>does touching the Kingdom of the thouſand years.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſame is teſtified by <hi>Irenaeus</hi> (<hi>lib.</hi> 5. <hi>cont. Her. c.</hi> 33.) where having at large ſet forth this Doctrine, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms it by the Authority of <hi>Papias</hi> in theſe words. Papias <hi>alſo the Auditor of</hi> John, <hi>the familiar friend of</hi> Policarpus <hi>an Ancient man, hath teſtified by writing theſe things in the fourth of his Books, for he hath writtten five.</hi> And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Papias</hi> thus much.</p>
                  <p>That <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> was of the ſame belief, it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed by <hi>Sixtus Senenſis (Biblioth. Stae. l.</hi> 6. <hi>An.</hi> 347.) by <hi>Feverdentius</hi> in his premonition before the five laſt Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the 5th. Book of <hi>Irenaeus.</hi> By <hi>Pamelius</hi> in <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doto ad Tertul. parad. paradox.</hi> 14.</p>
                  <p>That S. <hi>Melito</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Sardis</hi> held the ſame Doctrine is confeſſed by <hi>Pamelius</hi> in the ſame place; and thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it is that <hi>Gennadius Maſſilienſis</hi> in his Book <hi>de Eccleſ. dogmatibus,</hi> calls the followers of this opinion <hi>Melitani;</hi> as the ſame <hi>Pamelius</hi> teſtifies in his Notes upon that frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Tertullian de Spe fidelium.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Irenaeus</hi> his Faith in this point is likewiſe confeſſed by <hi>Euſebius,</hi> in the place before quoted in theſe words. <hi>He</hi> (Papias) <hi>was the Author of the like Error to moſt of the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Church, who alledged the Antiquity of the Man for a defence of their ſide, as to</hi> Irenaeus <hi>and whoſoever elſe ſeemed to be of the ſame opinion with him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By S. <hi>Hierome</hi> in the place above cited <hi>de ſcript. Eccleſ. S.</hi> 29. Again in <hi>Lib. Ezek.</hi> 11. in theſe words. <hi>For nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do we expect from Heaven a Golden</hi> Hieruſalem (<hi>accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Jewiſh tales which they call</hi> Duteroſſis) <hi>which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:57896:262"/>many of our own have followed: Eſpecially</hi> Tertullian <hi>in his Book</hi> de ſpe fidelium; <hi>and</hi> Lactantius <hi>in his ſeventh Book of Inſtitutions, and the frequent expoſitions of</hi> Victorinus Pictavionenſis: <hi>and of late</hi> Severus <hi>in his Dialogue which he calls</hi> Gallus: <hi>and to name the</hi> Greeks <hi>and to joyn together the firſt and laſt,</hi> Irenaeus <hi>and</hi> Apollinarius. Where we ſee he acknowledges <hi>Irenaeus</hi> to be of this opinion; but that he was the firſt that held it, I believe that that is more a Chriſtian untruth than <hi>Irenaeus</hi> his opinion a Judai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Fable. For he himſelf acknowledges in the place above cited, that <hi>Irenaeus</hi> followed <hi>Papias;</hi> and it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and confeſſed that <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> believed it long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him: and <hi>Irenaeus</hi> himſelf derives it from — <hi>Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteri qui</hi> Johannem <hi>diſcipulum Domini viderunt;</hi> from Prieſts which ſaw <hi>John</hi> the Diſciple of the Lord. Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by <hi>Pamelius, Sixtus Senenſis,</hi> and <hi>Faverdentius</hi> in the places above quoted.</p>
                  <p>Seeing therefore it is certain, even to the confeſſion of the Adverſaries, that <hi>Papias, Juſtin Martyr, Meleto</hi> and <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> the moſt conſiderable and eminent men of their Age, did believe and teach this Doctrine; and ſeeing it has been proved as evidently as a thing of this nature can be, that none of their contemporaries oppoſed or condemned it; It remains according to Cardinal <hi>Perrons</hi> firſt rule; that this is to be eſteemed the Doctrine of the Church of that Age.</p>
                  <p>My ſecond Reaſon I form thus. Whatſoever Doctrine is taught by the Fathers of any Age, not as Doctors but as witneſſes of the Tradition of the Church, (that is, not as their own opinion, but as the Doctrine of the Church of their times) that is undoubtedly to be ſo eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; eſpecially if none contradicted them in it. But the Fathers above cited teach this Doctrine, not as their own private opinion, but as the Chriſtian Tradition, and as the Doctrine of the Church, neither did any contradict them in it. <hi>Ergo,</hi> it is undoubtedly to be ſo eſteemed.</p>
                  <p>The Major of this Syllogiſm, is Cardinal <hi>Perrons</hi> ſecond Rule and way of finding out the Doctrine of the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Church in any Age: and if it be not a ſure Rule, fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel the uſe of all Antiquity.</p>
                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:57896:263"/>
                  <p>And for the <hi>Minor,</hi> there will be little doubt of it, to him that conſiders, that <hi>Papias</hi> profeſſes himſelf to have received this Doctrine by unwritten Tradition, though not from the Apoſtles themſelves immediately, yet from their Scholars, as appears by <hi>Euſebius</hi> in the forecited third Book 33. Chapter.</p>
                  <p>That <hi>Irenaeus</hi> grounding it upon evident Scripture, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes that he learnt it, (whether mediately or immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I cannot tell) from <hi>(a) Presbyteri qui</hi> Johannem <hi>Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulum Domini viderunt.</hi> Prieſts or Elders who ſaw <hi>John</hi> the Lords Diſciple, and heard of him what our Lord taught of thoſe times (of the thouſand years) and alſo, as he ſays after, from <hi>Papias</hi> the Auditor of <hi>John</hi> the Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fellow of <hi>Polycarpus,</hi> an Ancient man who recorded it in writing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>(a) Faverdentius</hi> his Note upon this place is very Nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. <hi>Hinc apparet</hi> (ſaith he) from hence it appears that <hi>Irenaeus</hi> neither firſt invented this opinion, nor held it as proper to himſelf, but got this blot and blemiſh from cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Fathers. <hi>Papias</hi> I ſuppoſe and ſome other inglorious fellows, the familiar Friends of <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> are here intended.</p>
                  <p>I hope then if the Fathers which lived with the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles had their blots and blemiſhes; it is no ſuch horrid Crime for <hi>Calvin</hi> and the <hi>Century writers</hi> to impute the ſame to their great Grandchildren. <hi>Aetas parentum pejor avis progeniem fert vitioſiorem.</hi> But yet theſe inglorious Diſciples of the Apoſtles, though perhaps not ſo learned as <hi>Faverdentius,</hi> were yet certainly ſo honeſt, as not to invent lies and deliver them as Apoſtolick Tradition; or if they were not, what confidence can we place in any other unwritten Tradition.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, that <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> grounds it upon plain Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies of the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> and expreſs words of the <hi>New:</hi> he profeſſeth, <hi>That he, and all other Chriſtians of a right belief in all things, believe it;</hi> joyns them who believe it not, with them who deny the Reſurrection; or elſe ſays, that none denied this, but the ſame who denied the Reſurrection; and that indeed they were called Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, but in deed and Truth were none.</p>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:57896:263"/>
                  <p>Whoſoever, I ſay, conſiders theſe things will eaſily grant, that they held it not as their own opinion, but as the Doctrine of the Church and the Faith of Chriſtians.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon I conclude, whatſoever they held, not as their private opinion, but as the Faith of the Church, that was the Faith of the Church of their time: But this Doctrine they held, not as <hi>their</hi> private opinion, but as the Faith of the Church. <hi>Ergo,</hi> it was and is to be eſteemed the Faith of the Church.</p>
                  <p>

                     <q>Do ye confeſs that before ye expect the coming of Chriſt, this place <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> ſhall be again reſtored, and that your People ſhall be congregated, and rejoyce together with Chriſt, and the Patriarchs and the Prophets, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     <q>I have confeſſed to you before, that both I and many others do believe, as you well know, that this ſhall be; but that many again, who are (not) of the pure and holy opinion of Chriſtians, do not acknowledge this, I have alſo ſignified unto you: For I have declared unto you, that ſome called Chriſtians, but being indeed <hi>Atheiſts</hi> and impious <hi>Hereticks,</hi> do gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally teach blaſphemous and Atheiſtical and fooliſh things: but that you might know that I ſpeak not this to you on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, I will make a Book as near as I can of theſe our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations, where I will profeſs in writing that which I ſay before you; for I reſolve to follow not men, and the Doctrines of men, but God and the Doctrine of God. For although you chance to meet with ſome that are called Chriſtians, which do not confeſs this, but dare to Blaſpheme the God of <hi>Abraham,</hi> the God of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and the God of <hi>Jacob,</hi> which alſo ſay there is no Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Dead, but that as ſoon as they die their Souls are received into Heaven, do not ye yet think them Chriſtians: as neither if a man conſider rightly will he account the Sadducees and other Sectaries and Hereticks, as the <hi>Geniſtae</hi> and the <hi>Meriſtae</hi> and <hi>Galileans,</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> and <hi>Hellenians</hi> and <hi>Baptiſts</hi> and other ſuch to be <hi>Jews;</hi> but only that they are called <hi>Jews,</hi> and the Children of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and ſuch as with their lips confeſs God (as God
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:57896:264"/>himſelf cries out) but have their Hearts far from him. But I and all Chriſtians that in all things believe aright, both know that there ſhall be a Reſurrection of the Fleſh, and a thouſand years in <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> reſtored and adorned and inlarged; according as the Prophets, <hi>Ezekiel</hi> and <hi>Eſay</hi> and others do teſtifie: for thus ſaith <hi>Iſaiah</hi> of the time of this thouſand years. <hi>For there ſhall be a new Heaven and a new Earth, and they ſhall not remember the former,</hi> &amp;c.</q> And after.—<q>A certain man amongſt us whoſe name was <hi>John,</hi> one of the Twelve Apoſtles of Chriſt, in that <hi>Revelation</hi> which was exhibited unto him, hath foretold—That they which believe our Chriſt ſhall live in <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> a thouſand years, and that after, the Univerſal and everlaſting Reſurrection and Judgment ſhall be.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have preſumed in the beginning of <hi>Juſtin Martyrs</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to ſubſtitute (not) inſtead of (alſo) becauſe I am confident, that either by chance, or the fraud of ſome ill-willers to the Millinaries opinion; the place has been corrupted, and (<gap reason="symbol" extent="1 letter">

For if we retain the uſual reading—<hi>But that many who are alſo of the pure and holy opinion of Chriſtians do not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge this, I have alſo ſignified unto you;</hi> then muſt we conclude, that <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> himſelf did believe the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of them which denied the thouſand years, to be the pure and holy opinion of Chriſtians: and if ſo, why did he not himſelf believe it? nay how could he but believe it to be true, profeſſing it (as he does if the place be right) to be the pure and holy opinion of Chriſtians: for how a falſe Doctrine can be the pure and holy opinion of Chriſtians, what Chriſtian can conceive? or if it may be ſo, how can the contrary avoid the being untrue, unho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and not the opinion of Chriſtians?</p>
                  <p>Again, if we read the place thus—<hi>That many who are alſo of the pure and holy opinion of Chriſtians, do not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge this, I have alſo ſignified:</hi> certainly there wll be neither ſenſe nor reaſon, neither coherence nor conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence in the words following—<hi>For I have told you of many called Chriſtians, but being indeed Atheiſts and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks,

And therefore to diſguiſe this inconſequence, the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlator has thought fit to make uſe of a falſe Tranſlation, and inſtead of—<hi>for I have told you,</hi> to make it,—<hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides I have told you of many,</hi> &amp;c. Again, if <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> had thought this <hi>the pure and holy opinion of Chriſtians,</hi> or them good and holy Chriſtians that held it; why does he rank them with them that denyed the Reſurrection?

                     </gap> in the place of <gap reason="symbol" extent="1 letter">

Neither need any man think ſtrange that this misfortune of the change of a Syllable ſhould befal this place, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders that in this place <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> tells us that he had ſaid the ſame things before, whereas nothing to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe appears now in him. And that in <hi>Victorinus</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on the <hi>Revelation,</hi> wherein, (by S. <hi>Hieroms</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment) this Doctrine was ſtrongly maintained, there now appears nothing at all for it, but rather againſt it. And now from the place thus reſtored, theſe Obſervations offer themſelves unto us.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> ſpeaks not as a Doctor, but as a witneſs of the Doctrine of the Church of his time. I (ſaith he) and all Chriſtians that are of a right belief in all things hold this: And therefore from hence according to Cardinal <hi>Perrons</hi> Rule, we are to conclude, not probably but demonſtratively, that this was the Doctrine of the Church of that time.</p>
                  <pb n="88" facs="tcp:57896:265"/>
                  <p n="2">2. That they held it as a neceſſary matter, ſo far as to hold them no Chriſtians that held the Contrary: <hi>though you chance to meet with ſome called Chriſtians that do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs this, but dare to Blaſpheme the God of</hi> Abraham, Iſaac <hi>and</hi> Jacob, <hi>&amp;c. Yet do not ye think them Chriſtians:</hi> Now if <hi>Bellarmines</hi> Rule be true, that Councils then determine any thing as matters of Faith, when they pronounce them Hereticks that hold the Contrary; then ſure <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> held this Doctrine as a matter of Faith, ſeeing he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth them no Chriſtians, that contradict it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That the Doctrine is grounded upon the Scripture of the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New Teſtament</hi> and the <hi>Revelation</hi> of S. <hi>John,</hi> and that by a Doctor and Martyr, of the Church, and ſuch a one as was converted to Chriſtianity within 30 years after the Death of S. <hi>John,</hi> when in all probability there were many alive, that had heard him expound his own words and teach this Doctrine: and if probabilities will not be admitted, this is certain out of the moſt authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical records of the Church, that <hi>Papias</hi> the Diſciple of the Apoſtles Diſciples taught it the Church, profeſſing that he had received it from them that learned it from the Apoſtles: and if after all this, the Church of thoſe Times might Err in a Doctrine ſo clearly derived and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentically delivered, how without extream impudence can any Church in after times, pretend to Infallibility.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Millinaries</hi> Doctrine was over-born, by imputing to them that which they held not: by abrogating the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of S. <hi>John</hi>'s Revelation, as ſome did: or by derogat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from it, as others; aſcribing it not to S. <hi>John</hi> the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, but to ſome other <hi>John,</hi> they know not who: which —<hi>Dionyſius</hi> the firſt known adverſary of this doctrine and his followers; againſt the Tradition of <hi>Irenaeus, Juſtin Martyr,</hi> and all the Fathers their Anteceſſors: by calling it a Judaical opinion and yet allowing it as probable by corrupting the Authors for it, as <hi>Juſtin, Victorinus, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verus.</hi>

                  <head>VI. <hi>A Letter relating to the ſame Subject.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <opener>
                     <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>I Pray remember, that if a conſent of Fathers either conſtitute or declare a Truth to be neceſſary, or ſhew the opinion of the Church of their Time; then that opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Jeſuits, concerning Predeſtination upon preſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence (which had no oppoſer before S. <hi>Auſtin</hi>) muſt be ſo, and the contrary Heretical of the Dominicans; and the preſent Church differs from the Ancient, in not eſteeming of it as they did.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I pray remember, that if the Fathers be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, (when they ſpeak as witneſſes of Tradition) to ſhew the opinion of the Church of their Time, then the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Chiliaſts</hi> (which now is a Hereſie in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>) was once Tradition in the Opinion of the Church.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Since S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> had an opinion, that of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever no beginning was known, that came from the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, many Fathers might ſay things to be Tradition upon that ground only; but of this Opinion of the <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaſts,</hi> one of the ancienteſt Fathers <hi>Irenaeus</hi> ſays not onely that it was Tradition, but ſets down Chriſts own words when he taught it, and the pedigree of the opinion from Chriſt <hi rend="sup">a</hi> to <hi>John</hi> his Diſciple; from him to ſeveral Prieſts (whereof <hi>Papias</hi> was one who put it in writing) and ſo downwards; which can be ſhewn from no other Father, for no other opinion, either controverted, or uncontrover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, That if <hi>Papias</hi> either by his own error, or a deſire to deceive, could cozen the Fathers of the pureſt age in this, why not alſo in other things? why not in twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty as well as one, why not twenty others as well as he.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, That if the Fathers could be cozened, how could general Councils ſcape? who you ſay make Tradition one of their Rules, which can only be known from the Fathers?</p>
                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:57896:266"/>
                  <p>Sixthly, If they object, how could errors come in, and no beginning of them known? I pray remember to ask them the ſame Queſtion concerning the <hi>Millenaries,</hi> which laſted uncontradicted, until <hi>Dionyſius Alexandrinus</hi> two hundred and fifty years after Chriſt; and if they tell you that <hi>Papias</hi> was the firſt beginner, look in <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> and he will tell you the contrary. (<hi>Loco citato</hi> l. 5. c. 33.)</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, Remember, that if I ought not to condemn the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> out of Scripture, becauſe my interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation may deceive me; then they ought not to build their Infallibility upon it (and leſs upon her own word) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theirs may deceive them: unleſs the ſame thing may be a wall when you lean upon it, and a bulruſh when we do.</p>
                  <p>Eighthly, Remember that they cannot ſay, they truſt not their Interpretation in this, but a conſent of Fathers; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Fathers are not ſaid to be infallible, but as they tell the Opinion of the Church of their time, which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible: therefore they muſt firſt prove out of Scripture that ſhe is infallible, or elſe ſhe (who is her ſelf the ſubject of the Queſtion) cannot be allowed till then to give a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict for her ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Ninthly, Remember the <hi>Roman</hi> Church claims no Notes of the Church, but what agree with the <hi>Grecian</hi> too (as An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity, Succeſſion, Miracles, &amp;c.) but onely Communion with the Pope and Splendor; both which made for the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> in <hi>Liberius</hi> his time; and it were a hard Caſe, that becauſe the <hi>Greeks</hi> are poor upon Earth, they ſhould be ſhut out of Heaven.</p>
                  <p>Tenthly, Remember that if we have an Infallible way, we have no uſe (at leaſt no neceſſity) of an Infallible Guide; for if we may be ſaved by following the Scripture as near as we can (though we err) it is as good as any Interpreter to keep unity in charity (which is only needful) though not in opinion: and this cannot be ridiculous, becauſe they ſay, if any man miſinterpret the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> it ſhall not damn him; and why (without more ado) may not the ſame be ſaid of Scripture?</p>

                     <p>That the ſame thing at the ſame time ſhould have the true figure of a mans body, and ſhould not have the true figure of a mans body, is a Contradiction: But in the Doctrin of Tranſubſtantiation it is taught, that the ſame thing, (<hi>viz.</hi> our Saviour preſent in the Sacrament) has the true figure of a mans body, and has not the true figure of a mans body at the ſame time; therefore the Doctrin of Tranſubſtantiation contains Contradictions.</p>

                     <p>I prove it, according to the ſeveral parts of it: And firſt, for the firſt part. He muſt have the Figure of a mans body in the Euchariſt, who is there without any real alteration or difference from the natural body of a man: But our Saviour, according to the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Doctrin of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation, is in the Sacrament without any real altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or difference from the natural body of a man: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore according to this Doctrin he muſt there have the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of a mans body. To the ſecond part, that he muſt not have the figure of a mans body in the Sacrament, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this Doctrin, thus I prove it. He muſt not have the figure of a mans body in the Euchariſt, which muſt not have extenſion there: But our Saviours body, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Doctrin of Tranſubſtantiation, muſt not have extenſion there; Therefore, according to this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin, he muſt not have the figure of a mans body there. The Major of this Syllogiſm I proved, becauſe the figure of a mans body could not be without extenſion. The Minor I proved thus; That muſt not have extenſion in the Euchariſt, whoſe every part is together in one and the ſame point: But according to this Doctrin, every part of our Saviours body muſt be here in one and the ſame point: therefore here it muſt not have extenſion.</p>

                     </speaker>
                     <p>Anſwered, by diſtinguiſhing the Major of the firſt Syllogiſm, and ſaid; that he muſt not have the true figure of a mans body, according to the reaſon of a figure taken in its eſſential conſideration, which is to have <hi>poſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onem partium ſic &amp; ſic extra partes;</hi> but not the accidental conſideration, which is in <hi>ordine ad locum.</hi> And this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer he applied for the ſolution of the Minor, ſaying thus, Our Saviour is there without any real alteration intrinſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, but not extrinſecal; for he is not changed in order to himſelf, but in order to place: Or otherwiſe, he is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in his continual exiſtence, which is only <hi>modus eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae</hi> and inſeparable even by divine power, though altered <hi>in modo exiſtendi,</hi> which is ſituation and required to figure taken in order to place.</p>

                     <p>Againſt this it was replied by <hi>Chillingworth:</hi> That the diſtinction of a mans body as conſidered in it ſelf, and as conſidered in reference to place, is vain, and no ſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Argument: And thus he proved it; If it be impoſſible, that any thing ſhould have ſeveral parts one out of another in order, and reference of each to other, without having theſe parts in ſeveral places; then the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction is vain: But it is impoſſible, that any thing ſhould have ſeveral parts one out of another, without having theſe parts in ſeveral places; Therefore the diſtinction is vain.</p>
                     <p>The Major of this Syllogiſm he took for granted.</p>
                     <p>The Minor he proved thus: Whatſoever body is in the proper place of another body, muſt of neceſſity be in that very body, by poſſeſſing the demenſions of it: therefore, whatſoever hath ſeveral parts one out of the other, muſt of neceſſity have them one out of the place of the other; and conſequently in ſeveral places.</p>
                     <p>For illuſtration of this Argument he ſaid; If my head and belly and thighs and legs be all in the very ſame place; of neceſſity my head muſt be in my belly, and my belly in my thighs, and my thighs in my legs, and all of them in my feet, and my feet in all of them; and therefore if my head be out of my belly, it muſt be out of the place where my belly is; and if it be not out of the place where my belly is, it is not out of my belly but in it.</p>
                     <p>Again, to ſhew that according to the Doctrin of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation, our Saviours body in the Euchariſt hath not the ſeveral parts of it out of one another, he diſputed thus: Whereſoever there is a body having ſeveral parts one out of the other, there muſt be ſome middle parts ſevering the extreme parts: But here, according to this Doctrin, the extreme parts are not ſevered, but altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the ſame point; Therefore here our Saviours Body cannot have parts one out of other.</p>

                     <p>To all this (for want of a better Anſwer) gave only this. <hi>Let all Scholars peruſe theſe.</hi> After, upon better conſideration, he wrote by the ſide of the laſt Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logiſm this: <hi>Quoad entitatem verum eſt, non quoad locum,</hi> that is, according to entity it is true, but not according to

                        <hi>Chillingworth</hi> Replyed, That to ſay the extreme parts of a body are ſevered by the middle parts according to their entity, but not according to place, is ridiculous. His rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are firſt, Becauſe ſevering of things is nothing elſe, but putting or keeping them in ſeveral places, as every ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly woman knows; and therefore to ſay, they are ſevered but not according to place, is as if you ſhould ſay, They are heated, but not according to heat; they are cooled, but not according to cold: Indeed is it to ſay, they are ſevered, but not ſevered.</p>

                  <p>Now to believe that the Church was an infallible Guide, and to be believed in all things which ſhe requires us to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, I was induced: Firſt, becauſe there was nothing that could reaſonably conteſt with the Church about this Office, but the Scripture: and that the Scripture was this Guide, I was willing to believe, but that I ſaw not how it could be made good, without depending upon the Churches authority.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That Scripture is the Word of God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That the Scripture is a perfect rule of our duty.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That the Scripture is ſo plain in thoſe things that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern our duty, that whoſoever deſires and endeavors to find the will of God, there ſhall either find it, or at leaſt not dangerouſly miſtake it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I was drawn to this belief, becauſe I concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that it was evident, out of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> that there muſt be unto the worlds end a Succeſſion of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, by adhering to whom, men might be kept from wavering in matters of faith, and from being carried up and down with every wind of falſe doctrin.</p>
                  <p>That no Succeſſion of Paſtors could guard their adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents from danger of error, if themſelves were ſubject un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to error, either in teaching that to be neceſſary which is not ſo, or denying that to be neceſſary which is ſo: and therefore.</p>
                  <p>That there was and muſt be ſome Succeſſion of Paſtors, which was an infallible guide in the way to Heaven; and which ſhould not poſſibly teach any thing to be neceſſary which was not ſo; nor any thing not neceſſary which was ſo: upon this ground I concluded, that ſeeing there muſt be ſuch a Succeſſion of Paſtors, as was an infallible guide;
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:57896:269"/>and there was no other (but that of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>) even by the confeſſion of all other Societies of Paſtors in the world; that therefore that Succeſſion of Paſtors is that infallible Guide of Faith which all men muſt follow.</p>
                  <p>Upon theſe grounds I thought it neceſſary for my ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to believe the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, in all that ſhe thought to be, and propoſed as neceſſary.</p>
                  <p>Againſt theſe Arguments it hath been demonſtrated un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me; and Firſt againſt the firſt. That the reaſon why we are to believe the Scripture to be the word of God, neither is nor can be the Authority of the preſent Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which cannot make good her Authority any other way, but by pretence of Scripture: and therefore ſtands not unto Scripture (no not in reſpect of us) in the relation of a Foundation to a building, but of a building to a Foundation, doth not ſupport Scripture, but is ſupported by it. But the general conſent of Chriſtians of all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Ages, a far greater company than that of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and delivering univerſally the Scripture for the word of God, is the ordinary external reaſon why we believe it: whereunto the Teſtimonies of the Jews, enemies of Chriſt, add no ſmall moment for the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of ſome part of it.</p>
                  <p>That whatſoever ſtood upon the ſame ground of Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Tradition with Scripture, might juſtly challenge belief, as well as Scripture: but that no Doctrin not written in Scripture, could juſtly pretend to as full Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as the Scripture, and therefore we had no reaſon to believe it with that degree of faith, wherewith we believe the Scripture.</p>
                  <p>That it is unreaſonable to think, that he that reads the Scripture, and uſes all means appointed for this purpoſe, with an earneſt deſire and with no other end, but to find the will of God and obey it, if he miſtake the meaning of ſome doubtful places, and fall unwillingly into ſome errors, unto which no vice or paſſion betrays him, and is willing to hear reaſon from any man that will undertake to ſhew him his error: I ſay, that it is unreaſonable to think, that a God of goodneſs will impute ſuch an error to ſuch a man.</p>
                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:57896:269"/>
                  <p>Againſt the ſecond it was demonſtrated unto me, that the place I built on ſo confidently, was no Argument at all for the Infallibility of the Succeſſion of Paſtors in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, but a very ſtrong Argument againſt it.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, no Argument for it; becauſe it is not certain, nor can ever be proved, that S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks there of any ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion; <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.11, 12, 13. For let that be granted which is deſired, that in the 13. ver. by <hi>[until we all meet]</hi> is meant, until all the Children of God meet in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Faith; that is, unto the Worlds end: yet it is not ſaid there, <hi>that he gave Apoſtles and Prophets,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>which ſhould continue,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>until we all meet,</hi> by connecting the 13. <hi>ver.</hi> to the 11. But he gave (then upon his Aſcenſion and miraculouſly endowed) Apoſtles and Prophets, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for the work of the miniſtry, for the Conſummation of the Saints, for the Edification of the Body of Chriſt, until we all meet, that is, if you will, unto the Worlds end. Neither is there any incongruity, but that the Apoſtles and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which lived then, may in good ſenſe be ſaid, now at this time and ever hereafter to do thoſe things which they are ſaid to do: For who can deny but S. <hi>Paul</hi> the Apoſtle and Doctor of the Gentiles, and S. <hi>John</hi> the Evangeliſt and Prophet, do at this very time (by their writings, though not by their perſons) do the work of the miniſtry, conſummate the Saints, and Edifie the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it cannot be ſhewn or proved from hence, that there is or was to be any ſuch ſucceſſion: becauſe S. <hi>Paul</hi> here tells us only, that he gave ſuch in the time paſt, not that he promiſed ſuch in the time to come.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it is evident, that God promiſed no ſuch ſucceſſion, becauſe it is not certain that he hath made good any ſuch promiſe; for who is ſo impudent as to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, that there are now, and have been in all Ages ſince Chriſt, ſome Apoſtles and ſome Prophets and ſome Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts and ſome Paſtors and Teachers: Eſpecially ſuch as he here ſpeaks of, that is, endowed with ſuch gifts as Chriſt gave upon his Aſcenſion; of which he ſpeaks in the 8 <hi>ver.</hi> ſaying; <hi>He led Captivity Captive, and gave gifts
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:57896:270"/>unto men.</hi> And that thoſe gifts were — Men endowed with extraordinary Power and Supernatural gifts — it is apparent, becauſe theſe Words, <hi>and he gave ſome Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, ſome Prophets,</hi> &amp;c. are added by way of explication and illuſtration of that which was ſaid before — <hi>and he gave gifts unto Men:</hi> And if any man except hereunto, that though the Apoſtles and Prophets and Evangeliſts were extraordinary and for the Plantation of the Goſpel, yet Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors were ordinary and for continuance: I anſwer, it is true, ſome Paſtors are ordinary and for continuance, but not ſuch as are here ſpoken of: not ſuch as are endowed with the ſtrange and heavenly gifts, which Chriſt gave not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Apoſtles and Prophets and Evangeliſts, but to the inferior Paſtors and Doctors of his Church, at the firſt Plantation of it: And therefore S. <hi>Paul</hi> in the 1ſt. to the <hi>Corinth.</hi> 12.28. (to which place we are referred by the Margent of the Vulgar Tranſlation, for the explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this,) places this gift of teaching amongſt, and prefers it before many other miraculous gifts of the Holy Ghoſt: Paſtors there are ſtill in the Church, but not ſuch as <hi>Titus</hi> and <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Apollos</hi> and <hi>Barnabas:</hi> not ſuch as can juſtly pretend to immediate inſpiration and illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Holy Ghoſt: And therefore ſeeing there neither are nor have been for many Ages in the Church, ſuch Apoſtles and Prophets, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as here are ſpoken of, it is certain he promiſed none; or otherwiſe we muſt blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemouſly charge him with breach of his promiſe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I anſwer, that if by <hi>dedit he gave,</hi> be meant <hi>promiſit,</hi> he <hi>promiſed</hi> for ever; then all were promiſed and all ſhould have continued. If by <hi>dedit</hi> be not meant <hi>promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit,</hi> then he promiſed none ſuch, nor may we expect any ſuch by vertue of, or warrant from this Text that is here alledged: And thus much for the firſt Aſſumpt which was, that the place was no Argument for an infallible ſucceſſion in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now for the ſecond, That it is a ſtrong Argument againſt it, thus I make it good.</p>
                  <p>The Apoſtles and Prophets and Evangeliſts and Paſtors, which our Saviour gave upon his Aſcenſion, were given
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:57896:270"/>by him that they might Conſummate the Saints, do the work of the Miniſtry, Edifie the Body of Chriſt, until we all come into the Unity of Faith, that we be not like Children wavering and carried up and down with every wind of Doctrine. The Apoſtles and Prophets, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that then were, do not now in their own perſons and by oral inſtruction do the work of the Miniſtry, to the intent we may be kept from wavering and being carried up and down with every wind of Doctrine: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they do this ſome other way: Now there is no other way by which they can do it, but by their writings; and therefore by their writings they do it: therefore by their writings and believing of them we are to be kept from wavering in matters of Faith: therefore the Scriptures of the Apoſtles and Prophets and Evangeliſts are our Guides. Therefore not the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt I ſhould have anſwered that in propriety of Speech I could not ſay that I <hi>knew</hi> it, but that I did as undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>believe</hi> it, as thoſe things which I did know. For though (as I conceive) we may be properly ſaid to believe that which we know, yet we cannot ſay truly, that we know that which we only believe upon report and hearſay, be it never ſo conſtant, never ſo general: For ſeeing the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of men is made up of particulars, and every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular man may deceive and be deceived, it is not impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, though exceedingly improbable, that all men ſhould
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:57896:273"/>conſpire to do ſo. Yet I deny not that the popular phraſe of Speech will very well bear, that we may ſay we <hi>know</hi> that which in truth we only <hi>believe,</hi> provided the grounds of our belief be morally certain.</p>
                  <p>Neither do I take any exception to the Nephews an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, made to his Uncles 2, 3, 4. and 5. Interrogatories. But grant willingly as to the firſt, that it is not much ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial whether I remember or not any particular Author of ſuch a general and conſtant report. Then, that the Teſtimony of one or two Witneſſes, though never ſo credible, could add nothing to that belief which is alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy at the height, nay perhaps that my own ſeeing theſe Cities would make no acceſſion, add no degree to the ſtrength and firmneſs of my Faith concerning this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, only it would change the kind of my aſſent, and make me <hi>know</hi> that which formerly I did but <hi>believe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To the fourth, that ſeeming Reaſons are not much to be regarded againſt ſenſe or experience and moral Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainties (but withal I ſhould have told my Uncle, that I fear his ſuppoſition is hardly poſſible, and that the nature of the thing will not admit, that there ſhould be any great, nay any probable reaſons invented to perſwade me that there never was ſuch a City as <hi>London</hi>) and therefore if any man ſhould go about to perſwade me that there never was ſuch a City as <hi>London;</hi> That there were no ſuch men as called themſelves, or were called by others Proteſtants, in <hi>England,</hi> in the days of Q. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> perhaps ſuch a mans Wit might delight me, but his reaſons ſure would never perſwade me.</p>
                  <p>Hitherto we ſhould have gone hand in hand together, but whereas in the next place he ſays — <hi>In like manner then you do not doubt, but a Catholick living in a Catholick Country, may undoubtedly know what was the publick Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Country in his Fathers days, and that ſo aſſuredly that it were a meer madneſs for him to doubt thereof.</hi>—I ſhould have craved leave to tell my Uncle that he preſumed too far upon his Nephews yielding diſpoſition. For that as it is a far more eaſie thing to know, and more authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically teſtified, that there were ſome men called Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:57896:273"/>by themſelves and others, than what opinions theſe Proteſtants held, divers men holding divers things, which yet were all called by this name. So is it far more eaſie for a <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> to know that in his Fathers days there were ſome men, for their outward Communion with and ſubordination to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> called <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> than to know what was the Religion of thoſe men who went under this name, For they might be as different one from another in their belief, as ſome Proteſtants are from others.</p>
                  <p>As for example, had I lived before the <hi>Lateran</hi> Council which condemned <hi>Berengarius,</hi> poſſibly I might have known that the belief of the <hi>Real preſence</hi> of Chriſt in the Sacrament was part of the publick Doctrine of my Country: But whether the Real abſence of the Bread and Wine after Conſecration, and their Tranſubſtantiation into Chriſts Body, were likewiſe <hi>Catholick</hi> Doctrine at that time, <hi>that,</hi> I could not have known, ſeeing that all men were at liberty to hold it was ſo, or it was not ſo.</p>
                  <p>Moreover I ſhould have told my Uncle, that living now, I know it is <hi>Catholick</hi> Doctrine, That the Souls of the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed enjoy the Viſion of God: But if I had lived in the Reign of <hi>Pope John</hi> the XXII, I ſhould not have known that then it was ſo, conſidering that many good Catholicks be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that time had believed, and then, even the <hi>Pope</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf did believe the contrary: and he is warranted by <hi>Bellarmine</hi> for doing ſo, becauſe the Church had not then defined it.</p>
                  <p>I ſhould have told him further that either Catholicks of the preſent time do ſo differ in their belief, that what ſome hold lawful and pious, others condemn as unlawful and impious: or elſe that all now conſent, and conſequently make it <hi>Catholick</hi> Doctrine, That it is not unlawful to make the uſual Pictures of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> and to ſet them in Churches to be adored. But had I lived in S. <hi>Auſtins</hi> time, I ſhould then have been taught another Leſſon: To wit, that this Doctrine and practice was impious, and the contrary Doctrine Catholick.</p>
                  <pb n="106" facs="tcp:57896:274"/>
                  <p>I ſhould have told him that now I was taught that the Doctrine of Indulgences was an Apoſtolick Tradition: but had I lived 600 years ſince, and found that in all an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity there was no uſe of them: I ſhould either have thought the Primitive Church no faithful Steward in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frauding mens Souls of this Treaſure intended by God to them, and ſo neceſſary for them, or rather that the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Indulgences now practiſed in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was not then Catholick.</p>
                  <p>I ſhould have told him that the general practice of <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks now taught me that it was a pious thing to offer Incenſe and Tapers to the Saints and to their Pictures: But had I lived in the Primitive Church, I ſhould with the Church have condemned it in the <hi>Collyridians</hi> as Heretical.</p>
                  <p>I ſhould have repreſented to him <hi>Eraſmus</hi> his complaint againſt the Proteſtants, whoſe departing from the <hi>Roman</hi> Church occaſioned the determining, and exacting the belief of many points as neceſſary, wherein before <hi>Luther</hi> men enjoyed the Liberties of their Judgments and Tongues and Pens. <hi>Antea,</hi> ſaies he, <hi>licebat varias agitare quaeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ones, de poteſtate Pontificis, de Condonationibus, de reſtituendo, de Purgatorio: nunc tutum non eſt hiſcere, ne de his quidèm, quae pie verèque dicuntur. Et credere cogimur, quod homo gig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit ex ſe opera meritoria, quod benefact is meretur vitam aeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam, etiam de condigno, Quòd B. Virgo poteſt imperare Filio cum Patre regnanti ut exaudiat hujus aut illius preces, aliaque permulta ad quae piae mentes inhorreſcunt.</hi> And from hence I ſhould have collected, as I think very probably, that it was not then ſuch a known and certain thing, what was the Catholick Faith in many points which now are deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, but that divers men who held external Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with that Church which now holds theſe as matters of Faith, conceived themſelves no waies bound to do ſo, but at liberty to hold as they ſaw reaſon.</p>
                  <p>I ſhould have ſhewed him by the confeſſion of another Learned Catholick, That through the negligence of the Biſhops in former Ages, and the indiſcreet Devotion of the People many opinions and practices were brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Church, which at firſt perhaps were but wink'd at,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:57896:274"/>after tolerated, then approved, and at length after they had ſpread themſelves into a ſeeming Generality, confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for good and Catholick: and that therefore there was no certainty, that they came from the beginning whoſe beginning was not known.</p>
                  <p>I ſhould have remembred him that even by the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> many corruptions and ſuperſtitions had by inſenſible degrees inſinuated them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into the very Maſs and Offices of the Church, which they thought fit to caſt out: and therefore ſeeing that ſome abuſes have come in, God knows how, and have been caſt out again, who can aſcertain me that ſome Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors have not got in, and while men ſlept (for it is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent they did ſleep) gathered ſuch ſtrength, gotten ſuch deep root, and ſo incorporated themſelves, like Ivy in a Wall, in the State and polity of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, that to pull them up had been to pull them down, by raſing the Foundation on which it ſtands, to wit, the Churches Infallibility? Beſides as much water paſſes under the Mill which the Miller ſees not, ſo who can warrant me that ſome old corruptions, might not eſcape from them, and paſs for Original and Apoſtolick Traditions? I ſay <hi>might not;</hi> though they had been as ſtudious to reduce all to the primitive State, as they were to preſerve them in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent State, as diligent to caſt out all Poſtnate and intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct opinions, as they were to perſuade men that there were none ſuch, but all as truly Catholick and Apoſtolick as they were <hi>Roman.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſhould have declared unto him that many things rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned up in the Roll of Traditions are now grown out of faſhion and out of uſe in the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that either they believed them not, whatever they pretended, or were not ſo obedient to the Apoſtles com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand as they themſelves interpret it — <hi>Keep the Traditions which ye have received, whether by word or by our Epiſtle.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And ſeeing there have been ſo many viciſſitudes and changes in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church: Catholick Doctrines grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing exolete, and being degraded from their Catholiciſm, and perhaps depreſt into the number of Hereſies: Points
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:57896:275"/>of Indifference, or at leaſt <hi>Aliens</hi> from the Faith, getting firſt to be Inmates, after, procuring to be made <hi>Denizons,</hi> and in proceſs of time neceſſary members of the Body of the Faith: Nay Old Hereſies ſometimes like old Snakes, caſting their Skin and their Poyſon together, and becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wholſom and Catholick Doctrines. I muſt have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired pardon of my Uncle, if I were not ſo undoubtedly certain what was and what was not Catholick Doctrine in the days of my Fathers.</p>
                  <p>Nay perhaps I ſhould have gone further and told him, That I was not fully aſſured what was the Catholick Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine in ſome points, no not at this preſent time. For inſtance, to lay the Axe unto the Root of the Tree: the infallibility of the preſent Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> in determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing controverſies of Faith, is eſteemed indeed by divers that I have met with, not only an Article of Faith, but a Foundation of all other Articles. But how do I know there are not, nay why ſhould I think there are not in the World divers good Catholicks of the ſame mind touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this matter, which <hi>Mirandula, Panormitan, Cuſanus, Florentinus, Clemangis, Waldenſis, Occham,</hi> and divers others were of, who were ſo far from holding this Doctrine the Foundation of Faith, that they would not allow it any place in the Fabrick.</p>
                  <p>Now <hi>Bellarmine</hi> has taught us that no Doctrine is Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick, nor the contrary Heretical, that is denied to be ſo by ſome good Catholicks. From hence I collect that in the time of the forenamed Authors, this was not Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Doctrine, nor the contrary Heretical; and being then not ſo, how it could ſince become ſo, I cannot well underſtand: If it be ſaid that it has ſince been defined by a General Council; I ſay firſt, This is falſe, no Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil has been ſo fooliſh as to define that a Council is Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible, for unleſs it were preſumed to be Infallible before, who or what could aſſure us of the Truth of this definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Secondly if it were true it were ridiculous: for he that would queſtion the Infallibility of all Councils in all their Decrees, would as well queſtion the Infallibility of this Council in this Decree. This therefore was not, is not,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:57896:275"/>nor ever can be an Article of Faith, unleſs God himſelf would be pleaſed (which is not very likely) to make ſome new Revelation of it from Heaven.</p>

                     </gap>, the Fountain of the Error in this matter is this: That the whole Religion of the <hi>Roman Church</hi> and every point of it, is conceived or pretended to have iſſued Originally out of the Fountain of Apoſtolick Tradition, either in themſelves or in the principles from which they are evidently deducible. Whereas it is evident that many of their Doctrines, may be Originally derived from the Decrees of Councils, many from Papal definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, many from the Authority of ſome great Man; To which purpoſe it is very remarkable what <hi>Gregory Nazian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen</hi> ſays of <hi>Athanaſius.

                  <p>And as memorable that in the late great Controverſie about Predetermination and Free-will, diſputed before <hi>Pope Clement</hi> VII. by the Jeſuits and Dominicans, The <hi>Popes</hi> reſolution was, if he had determined the matter, to define for that opinion which was moſt agreeable, not to Scripture, nor to Apoſtolick Tradition, nor to a conſent of Fathers, but to the Doctrine of S. <hi>Auſtin:</hi> ſo that if the <hi>Pope</hi> had made an Article of Faith of this Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie, it is evident S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> had been the Rule of it.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes upon erroneous grounds Cuſtoms have been brought in, God knows how, and after have ſpread them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves through the whole Church. Thus <hi>Gordonius Hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leius</hi> confeſſes, that becauſe Baptiſm and the Euchariſt had been anciently given both together to men of ripe years, when they were converted to Chriſtianity; Afterwards by Error when Infants were Baptized, they gave the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt alſo to Infants. This Cuſtom in ſhort time grew Univerſal, and in S. <hi>Auſtins</hi> time paſſed currantly for an Apoſtolick Tradition, and the Euchariſt was thought as neceſſary for them as Baptiſm. This Cuſtom the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath again caſt out, and in ſo doing profeſt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:57896:276"/>her no regard to the traditions of the Apoſtles, or that this was none of that number. But yet ſhe cannot poſſibly avoid but that this example is a proof ſufficient that many things may get in by Error into the Church, and by degrees obtain the eſteem and place of Apoſtolick Traditions which yet are not ſo.</p>
                  <p>The Cuſtom of denying the Laity the Sacramental Cup, and the Doctrine that it is lawful to do ſo, who can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to derive from Apoſtolick Tradition? Eſpecially when the
<note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Seſſ.</hi> XIII.</note> Council of Conſtance the Patron of it, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes that Chriſts inſtitution was under both kinds, and that the faithful in the Primitive Church received it in both. — <hi>Licet Chriſt us,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Although Chriſt after his Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per inſtituted and adminiſtred this venerable Sacrament under both kinds. — Although in the Primitive Church this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were received by the faithful under both kinds.</hi> — Non obſtante, <hi>&amp;c. — Yet all this notwithſtanding this Cuſtom for the avoiding of Scandals</hi> (to which the Primitive Church was as obnoxious as the preſent is) <hi>was upon juſt reaſon brought in, that Laicks ſhould receive only under one kind.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Brought in therefore it was, and ſo is one of thoſe Doctrines which <hi>Lerinenſis</hi> calls — <hi>inducta non tradita, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venta non accepta,</hi> &amp;c. therefore all the Doctrine of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church does not deſcend from Apoſtolick Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
                  <p>But if this Cuſtom came not from the Apoſtles, from what Original may we think that it deſcended? Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly from no other than from the belief of the ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial preſence of whole Chriſt under either kind. For this opinion being once ſetled in the Peoples minds, that they had as much by one kind as by both; both Prieſt and People quickly began to think it ſuperfluous, to do the ſame thing twice at the ſame time; and thereupon, being (as I ſuppoſe) the Cuſtom required that the Bread ſhould be received firſt, having received that, they were contented that the Prieſt ſhould ſave the pains, and the Pariſh the charge of unneceſſary reiteration. This is my Conjecture which I ſubmit to better judgments; but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be true or falſe, one thing from hence is certain,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:57896:276"/>That immemorial Cuſtoms may by degrees prevail upon the Church, ſuch as have no known beginning nor Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, of which yet this may be evidently known, that their beginning whenſoever it was, was many years, nay, many Ages after the Apoſtles.</p>
                  <p>* S. <hi>Paul</hi> commands that nothing be done in the Church but for edification.
<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.26.</note> He ſays, and if that be not enough, he proves in the ſame place, that it is not for edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that either Publick Prayers, Thankſgiving and Hymns to God, or Doctrine to the People ſhould be in any Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage which the Aſſiſtants generally underſtand not;
<note place="margin">27, 28.</note> and thereupon forbids any ſuch practice though it were in a Language miraculouſly infuſed into the ſpeaker by the Holy Ghoſt: unleſs he himſelf or ſome other preſent could and would interpret. He tells us that to do other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe is to ſpeak into the Air:
<note place="margin">9.11.</note> That it is to play the <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians</hi> to one another: That to ſuch Bleſſings and Thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givings, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="16"/> the ignorant for want of underſtanding cannot ſay <hi>Amen.</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> He clearly intimates that to think otherwiſe is to be Children in underſtanding. Laſtly, in the end of the Chapter he tells all that were Prophets and Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al among the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="37"/> That the things written by him are the Commandments of God. Hereupon <hi>Lyranus</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the place acknowledgeth that in the Primitive Church, Bleſſings and all other Services were done in the Vulgar Tongue. Cardinal <hi>Cajeton</hi> likewiſe upon the place tells us that out of this Doctrine of S. <hi>Paul</hi> it is conſequent, That it were better for the Edification of the Church, that the publick Prayers which are ſaid in the Peoples hearing, ſhould be delivered in a Language common both to the Clergy and the People. And I am confident that the Learnedſt Antiquary in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, nay that <hi>Baronius</hi> himſelf, were he alive again, could not produce ſo much as one example of any one Church, one City, one Pariſh in all the Chriſtian World, for five hundred years after Chriſt, where the Sermons to the People were in one Language, and the Service in another. Now it is confeſt on all hands to be againſt ſenſe and reaſon, that Sermons ſhould be made to the People in
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:57896:277"/>any Language not underſtood by them, and therefore it follows of neceſſity, that their Service likewiſe was in thoſe Tongues which the People of the place underſtood.</p>
                  <p>But what talk we of 500. years after Chriſt? when even the <hi>Lateran</hi> Council held in the year 1215. makes this Decree. <hi>Quoniam in pleriſque — Becauſe in many parts within the ſame City and Dioceſs, People are mixed of divers Languages, having under one Faith divers rites and faſhions, we ſtrictly command that the Biſhops of the ſaid Cities or Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſes provide fit and able men, who according to the diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities of their Rites and Languages may celebrate Divine Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices and adminiſter the Sacraments of the Church, inſtructing them both in word and example.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now after all this if any man will ſtill maintain, that the Divine Service in unknown Tongues is a matter of Apoſtolick Tradition, I muſt needs think the World is grown very impudent.</p>
                  <p>There are divers Doctrines in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church which have not yet arrived to the honour to be <hi>Donatae civitate,</hi> to be received into the number of Articles of Faith; which yet preſs very hard for it, and through the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity and multitude of their Attorneys that plead for them, in proceſs of time may very probably be admitted. Of this rank are the Bleſſed Virgins Immaculate concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, The <hi>Popes</hi> Infallibility in determining Controverſies, His ſuperiority to Councils, His indirect Power over Princes in Temporalties, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now as theſe are not yet matters of Faith and Apoſtolick Traditions, yet in after Ages in the days of our great Grandchildren may very probably become ſo, ſo why ſhould we not fear and ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, that many things now paſs currantly as points of Faith which <hi>Eccleſia ab Apoſtolis, Apoſtoli à Chriſto, Chriſtus à Deo recepit,</hi> which perhaps in the days of our great Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers had no ſuch reputation.</p>
                  <p>Cardinal <hi>Perron</hi> teaches us two Rules whereby to know the Doctrine of the Church in any Age. The firſt is when the moſt eminent Fathers of any Age agree in the affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of any Doctrine, and none of their Contempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raries oppoſe or condemn them, that is to be accounted
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:57896:277"/>the Doctrine of the Church. The ſecond: when one or more of theſe Eminent Fathers, ſpeak of any Doctrine not as Doctors but as witneſſes, and ſay, not, <hi>I think ſo, or hold ſo,</hi> but, <hi>the Church holds and believes this to be Truth.</hi> This is to be accounted the Doctrine of the Church. Now if neither of theſe Rules be good and certain, then are we deſtitute of all means to know what was the publick Doctrine of the Church in the days of our Fathers. But on the other ſide, if either of them be true, we run into a worſe inconvenience; for then ſurely the Doctrine of the Millinaries muſt be acknowledged to have been the Doctrine of the Church in the very next Age after the Apoſtles. For both the moſt eminent Fathers of that time, and even all whoſe Monuments are extant, or men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made of them, <hi>viz. Juſtin Martyr, Irenaeus, Tertullian, Melito Sardenſis,</hi> agree in the affirmation of this point, and none of their contemporary writers oppoſe or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn it: And beſides they ſpeak not as Doctors but as Witneſſes, not as of their own private opinion, but as Apoſtolick Tradition and the Doctrine of the Church.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Horantius</hi> and out of him <hi>Franciſcus a Sancta Clara</hi> teach us that under the Goſpel there is no where extant any precept of Invocating Saints, and tell us that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles reaſon of their giving no ſuch precept was, leſt the converted Gentiles might think themſelves drawn over from one kind of Idolatry to another. If this reaſon be good, I hope then the poſition whereof it is the reaſon is true, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Apoſtles did neither command nor teach, nor adviſe, nor perſuade the converted Gentiles to invocate Saints, for the reaſon here rendred ſerves for all alike, and if they did not, and for this reaſon did not ſo: how then in Gods name comes invocation of Saints to be an Apoſtolick Tradition?</p>
                  <p>The Doctrines of Purgatory, Indulgences, and Prayer to deliver Souls out of Purgatory are ſo cloſely conjoyned, that they muſt either ſtand or fall together; at leaſt, the firſt being the Foundation of the other two, if that be not Apoſtolick Tradition, the reſt cannot be ſo. And if that be ſo, what meant the Author of the Book of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:57896:278"/>to tell us that (after Death) <hi>the Souls of the righteous are in the hand of God, and there ſhall no torment touch them.</hi> What means S. <hi>John</hi> to teach us, That they are <hi>Bleſſed which Die in the Lord, for that they reſt from their Labours.</hi> But above all what meant Biſhop <hi>Fiſher</hi> in his Confutation of <hi>Luthers</hi> aſſertion ſo to prevaricate as to me he ſeems to do in the 18th. Art. in ſaying, <hi>multos fortaſſe movet,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Peradventure many are moved not to place too great Faith in Indulgences, becauſe the uſe of them may ſeem not of long ſtanding in the Church, and a very late invention among Chriſtians. To whom I anſwer that
<note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>Therefore it is not true that all the</hi> Roman <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines were taught by Chriſt and his Apoſtles.</hi>
                        </note> it is not certain by whom they began firſt to be taught. Yet ſome uſe there was of them, as they ſay very Ancient among the</hi> Romans, <hi>which we are given to underſtand by the Stations which were ſo frequented in that City. Moreover they ſay</hi> Gregory <hi>the firſt granted ſome in his time.</hi> And after <hi>Caeterum ut dicere caepimus,</hi> &amp;c. — <hi>But as we were ſaying, there are many things of which in the Primitive Church no mention was made, which yet upon doubts ariſing are become perſpicuous through the diligence of after times. Certainly, (to return to our buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs) no</hi> Orthodox <hi>man now doubts whether there be a Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory, of which yet among the Ancients there was made ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry rare or no mention. Moreover the</hi> Greeks <hi>to this very day believe not Purgatory. Who ſo will let him read the writings of the Ancient</hi> Greeks, <hi>and I think he ſhall find no ſpeech of Purgatory, or elſe very rarely. The Latines alſo received not this verity all at once but by little and little. Neither was the Faith whether of Purgatory or Indulgences ſo neceſſary in the Primitive Church as now it is, for then Charity was ſo fervent that every one was moſt ready to Die for Chriſt. Crimes were very rare, and thoſe which were, were puniſhed by the</hi> Canons <hi>with great ſeverity. But now a great part of the People would rather put off Chriſtianity than ſuffer the rigour of the</hi> Canons. <hi>That not without the great Wiſdom of the Holy Spirit, it hath come to paſs that after the courſe of ſo many years, the Faith of Purgatory and the uſe of Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences hath been by the</hi> Orthodox <hi>generally received as long as there was no care of Purgatory, no man look'd after Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences, for all the Credit of Indulgences depends on that. Take
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:57896:278"/>away Purgatory and what need is there of Indulgences. We therefore conſidering that Purgatory was a long while unknown. That after, partly upon Revelations partly upon Scripture it was believed by ſome, and that ſo at length the Faith of it was moſt generally received by the Orthodox Church, ſhall eaſily find out ſome reaſon of Indulgences. Seeing therefore it was ſo late ere Purgatory was known and received by the Univerſal Church, who now can wonder touching Indulgences, that in the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church there was no uſe of them? Indulgences therefore began after men had trembled a while at the Torments of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory. For then it is credible the Holy Fathers began to think more carefully by what means they might provide for their Flocks a remedy againſt thoſe Torments, for them eſpecially who had not time enough to fulfil the Penance which the</hi> Canons <hi>enjoyned.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Eraſmus</hi> tell us of himſelf, that though he did certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly know and could prove, that <hi>Auricular Confeſſion</hi> ſuch as is in uſe in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, were not of Divine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution: yet he would not ſay ſo, becauſe he conceived Confeſſion a great reſtraint from ſin, and very profitable for the times he lived in, and therefore thought it expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, that men ſhould rather by Error hold that neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and commanded, which was only profitable and advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, than by believing, though truly the non-neceſſity of it to neglect the uſe of that, as by experience we ſee moſt men do which was ſo beneficial: If he thought ſo of Confeſſion, and yet thought it not fit to ſpeak his mind, why might he not think the like of other points, and yet out of diſcretion and Charity hold his peace? And why might not others of his time do ſo as well as he: and if ſo, how ſhall I be aſſured that in the Ages before him there were not other men alike minded, who though they knew and ſaw Errors and Corruptions in the Church, yet conceiving more danger in the remedy, than harm in the diſeaſe, were contented <hi>hoc Catone</hi> — to let things alone as they were, leſt by attempting to pluck the Ivy out of the Wall, they might pull down the Wall it ſelf, with which the Ivy was ſo incorporated.</p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>Edwin Sandys</hi> relates that in his Travels he met
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:57896:279"/>with divers men, who, though they believed the Pope to be Antichriſt, and his Church Antichriſtian, yet thought themſelves not bound to ſeparate from the Communion of it: nay thought themſelves bound not to do ſo: becauſe the True Church was to be the Seat of Antichriſt, from the Communion whereof no man might divide himſelf upon any pretence whatſoever.</p>
                  <p>And much to this purpoſe is that which <hi>Charron</hi> tells us in his third <hi>Verité, cap.</hi> 4. §. 13.15. That although all that which the Proteſtants ſay falſly of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> were true, yet for all this they muſt not depart from it: and again, Though the Pope were Antichriſt, and the Eſtate of the Church, were ſuch (that is as cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt both in diſcipline and Doctrine) as they (Proteſtants) pretend, yet they muſt not go out of it. Both theſe aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions he proves at large in the above-cited Paragraphs, with very many and very plauſible reaſons: which I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve would prove his intent, had not the corruptions of the <hi>Roman.</hi> Church poſſeſſed and infected even the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Service of God among them, in which their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion was required: and did not the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> require the <hi>Belief</hi> of all her Errors, as the condition of her Communion. But howſoever be his reaſons conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive or not concluſive certainly this was the profeſt opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of him, and divers others; as by name <hi>Caſſander</hi> and <hi>Baldwin,</hi> who though they thought as ill of the Doctrine of the moſt prevailing part of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> as Proteſtants do, yet thought it their duty not to ſeparate from her Communion. And if there were any conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able number of conſiderable men thus minded (as I know not why any man ſhould think there was not) then it is made not only a moſt difficult, but even an impoſſible thing to know what was the <hi>Catholick</hi> Judgment of our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in the points of controverſie: ſeeing they might be joyned in Communion, and yet very far divided in opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. They might all live in obedience to the Pope, and yet ſome think him head of the Church by Divine right: others (as a great part of the <hi>French Church</hi> at this day) by Eccleſiaſtical conſtitution: others by neither, but
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:57896:279"/>by Practice and Uſurpation, wherein yet becauſe he had Preſcription of many Ages for him he might not juſtly be diſturbed.</p>
                  <p>All might go to Confeſſion and yet ſome only think it neceſſary; others only profitable. All might go to Maſs and the other Services of the Church, and ſome only like and approve the Language of it: others only tolerate it and wiſh it altered if it might be, without greater incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience. All might receive the Sacrament, and yet ſome believe it to be the Body and Blood of Chriſt, others on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Sacrament of it. Some that the Maſs was a true and proper Sacrifice, others only a Commemorative Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, or the Commemoration of a Sacrifice. Some that it was lawful for the Clergy to deny the Laiety the Sacramental Cup: others that it was lawful for them to receive in one kind only, ſeeing they could not in both. Some might adore Chriſt as preſent there according to his Humanity, others as preſent according to his Divine Nature only. Some might pray for the Dead as believing them in Purgatory: others upon no certain ground, but only that they ſhould rather have their Prayers and Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which wanted them not, than that they which did want them ſhould not have them. Some might pray to Saints upon a belief that they heard their Prayers and knew their Hearts; others might pray to them meaning nothing but to pray by them, that God for their ſakes would grant their Prayers: others thirdly, might not pray to them at all, as thinking it unneceſſary, others as fearing it unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, yet becauſe they were not fully reſolved, only forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it themſelves, and not condemning it in others.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Uncle.</hi> I pray you then remember alſo what it is that Proteſtants do commonly taunt and check Catholicks with, is it not that they believe Traditions?</p>
                  <p>It is a meer Calumny that Proteſtants condemn all kind of Traditions, who ſubſcribe very willingly to that of <hi>Vincentius Lerinenſis.</hi> That Chriſtian Religion is — <hi>res tradita non inventa,</hi> a matter of Tradition not of mans in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, is, what the Church received from the Apoſtles, (and by conſequence what the Apoſtles delivered to the
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:57896:280"/>Church) and the Apoſtles from Chriſt, and Chriſt from God. <hi>Chemnitius</hi> in his Examen of the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> hath liberally granted ſeven ſorts of Traditions, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants find no fault with him for it. Prove therefore any Tradition to be Apoſtolick, which is not written. Shew that there is ſome known Word of God which we are commanded to believe, that is not contained in the Books of the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> and we ſhall quickly ſhew that we believe Gods Word becauſe it is Gods, and not becauſe it is written. If there were any thing not written which had come down to us with as full and Univerſal a Tradition as the unqueſtioned Books of Canonical Scripture, That thing ſhould I believe as well as the Scripture: but I have long fought for ſome ſuch thing, and yet I am to ſeek: Nay I am confident no one point in Controverſie between Papiſts and Proteſtants can go in upon half ſo fair Cards, for to gain the eſteem of an Apoſtolick Tradition, as thoſe things which are now decried on all hands, I mean the opinion of the <hi>Chiliaſts;</hi> and <hi>the Communicating Infants.</hi> The latter by the confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Cardinal <hi>Perron, Maldonate,</hi> and <hi>Binius</hi> was the Cuſtom of the Church for 600 years at leaſt: It is expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and in terms vouched by S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> for the Doctrine of the Church and an Apoſtolick Tradition: it was never inſtituted by General Council, but in the uſe of the Church, as long before the Firſt general Council as S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> before the Council. There is no known Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the beginning of it: all which are the Catholick marks of an Apoſtolick Tradition, and yet this you ſay is not ſo, or if it be, why have you aboliſht it? The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Lineally derives its pedigree from our Saviour to St. <hi>John:</hi> from S. <hi>John</hi> to <hi>Papias:</hi> from <hi>Papias</hi> to <hi>Juſt in Martyr, Irenaeus, Melito Sardenſis, Tertullian</hi> and others of the two firſt Ages: who as they generally agree in the Affirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this Doctrine, and are not contradicted by any of their Predeceſſors: ſo ſome of them at leaſt, ſpeak to the point not as Doctors but Witneſſes, and deliver it for the Doctrine of the Church and Apoſtolick Tradition, and condemn the contrary as Hereſie. And therefore if
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:57896:280"/>there be any unwritten Traditions, theſe certainly muſt be admitted firſt: or if theſe which have ſo fair pretence to it muſt yet be rejected: I hope then we ſhall have the like liberty to put back Purgatory, and Indulgences, and Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation, and the Latin Service, and the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in one kind, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> none of which is of Age enough to be Page to either of the forenamed Doctrines, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the opinion of the Millenaries.</p>

                     <p>What think you means this word Tradition? No other thing certainly but that we confute all our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries by the Teſtimony of the former Church; ſaying unto them, this was the belief of our Fathers; Thus were we taught by them and they by theirs, without ſtop or ſtay till you come to Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>We confute our Adverſaries by ſaying thus—Truly a very eaſie confutation: But ſaying and proving are two Mens Offices; and therefore though you be excellent in the former, I fear when it comes to the Tryal, you will be found defective in the Latter.</p>

                     <p>And this no other but the <hi>Roman</hi> Church did or could ever pretend to, which being in truth unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable, and they cannot chooſe but grant the thing: Their laſt refuge is to laugh, and ſay that both Fathers and Councils did Err becauſe they were men, as if Proteſtants themſelves were more. Is it not ſo as I tell you?</p>
                     <p>No indeed, it is not by your leave, good <hi>Uncle.</hi> For firſt the <hi>Greek</hi> Church as every body knows, pretends to perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ſucceſſion of Doctrine, and undertakes to derive it from Chriſt and his Apoſtles, as confidently as we do ours: Neither is there any word in all this diſcourſe, but might have been urged as fairly and as probably for the <hi>Greek</hi> Church as for the <hi>Roman:</hi> and therefore ſeeing your Arguments fight for both alike, they muſt either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude for both, which is a direct impoſſibility, for then Contradictions ſhould be both true: or elſe which is moſt certain they conclude for neither and are not Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations as you pretend, (for never any Demonſtration could prove both parts of a Contradiction) but meer So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſms
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:57896:281"/>and Captions, as the progreſs of our anſwer ſhall juſtifie.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, It is ſo far from Proteſtants to grant the thing you ſpeak of, To wit, that the controverted Doctrines of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church came from Apoſtolick Tradition, that they verily believe ſhould the Apoſtles now live again, they would hardly be able to find amongſt you the Doctrin which they taught by reaſon of abundance of traſh and rubbiſh which you have laid upon it.</p>
                     <p>And laſtly, They pretend not that Fathers and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils may err and they cannot, nor that they were men and themſelves are not; but that you do moſt unjuſtly and vainly to father your inventions of Yeſterday upon the Fathers and Councils.</p>

                     <p>I know that we Catholicks do reverence Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions as much as Scripture it ſelf: neither do I ſee why we ſhould be blamed for it; for the words which Chriſt and his Apoſtles ſpake, muſt needs be as infallible as thoſe which were written.</p>
                     <p>True. But ſtill the queſtion depends, whether Chriſt and his Apoſtles did indeed ſpeak thoſe words which you pretend they did: we ſay with <hi>Irenaeus: Praeconiaverunt primum, ſcripſerunt poſtea.</hi> What they preacht firſt, that they wrote afterwards: we ſay with <hi>Tertullian—(Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as) Apoſtoli condiderunt, ipſi eis praedicando, tam vivâ quod aiunt voce, quam per Epiſtolas poſtea.</hi>—The Apoſtles found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Churches by their Preaching to them: firſt by word of mouth, then after by their writings. If you can prove the contrary do ſo and we yield: but hitherto you do nothing.</p>

                     <p>And as for the keeping of it, I ſee the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture it ſelf is beholden to Tradition (Gods providence pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſed) for the integrity both of the letter, and the ſenſe. Of the letter it is confeſt: of the ſenſe manifeſt. For the ſenſe being a diſtinct thing from the naked letter, and rather fetcht out by force of conſequence, than in expreſs and formal terms contained, (which is moſt true whether we ſpeak of <hi>Proteſtant</hi> ſenſe or the <hi>Catholick</hi>) it belongeth rather to Tradition than expreſs Text of Scripture.</p>
                     <pb n="121" facs="tcp:57896:281"/>
                     <p>That which you deſire to conclude is, That we muſt be beholden to Tradition for the ſenſe of Scripture: and your reaſon to conclude this is, becauſe the ſenſe is fetcht out by force of conſequence: This of ſome places of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture is not true, eſpecially thoſe which belong to faith and good manners, which carry their meaning in their foreheads. Of others it is true, but nothing to the purpoſe in hand, but rather directly againſt it. For who will not ſay, If I collect the ſenſe of Scripture by Reaſon, then I have it not from Authority: that is unleſs I am miſtaken. If I fetch it out by force of Conſequence, then I am not beholden to Tradition for it. But the letter of Scripture has been preſerved by Tradition, and therefore why ſhould we not receive other things upon Tradition as well as Scripture? I anſwer. The Jews Tradition preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the books of the Old Teſtament, and why then doth our Saviour receive theſe upon their Tradition, and yet condemn other things which they ſuggeſted as matters of Tradition? If you ſay it was becauſe theſe Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions came not from <hi>Moſes</hi> as they were pretended; I ſay alſo that yours are only pretended and not proved to come from the Apoſtles. Prove your Tradition of theſe Additions as well as you prove the Tradition of Scripture, and aſſure your ſelves, we then according to the injunction of the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> ſhall receive both with equal reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</p>
                  </sp>

                     <speaker>Nephew.</speaker>
                     <p>As it may appear by the ſenſe of theſe few words. <hi>Hoc eſt corpus meum,</hi> whether you take the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant</hi> or the <hi>Catholick</hi> ſenſe: For the ſame Text cannot have two contrary ſenſes of it ſelf, but as they are fetcht out by force of Argument; and therefore what ſenſe hath beſt Tradition to ſhew for it ſelf that's the Truth.</p>
                     <p>This is neither Proteſtant nor Catholick ſenſe, but if we may ſpeak the truth direct nonſenſe. For what if the ſame Text cannot have contrary ſenſes: is there therefore no means but Tradition to determin which is the true ſenſe? What connexion or what relation is there between this Antecedent and this Conſequent? certainly they are
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:57896:282"/>meer ſtrangers to one another, and until they met by chance in this argument, never ſaw each other before. He that can find a third propoſition to joyn them together in a good ſyllogiſm, I profeſs unto you, — <hi>Erit mihi mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus Appollo.</hi> — But what if of theſe two contrary ſenſes the one, that is the Literal, draw after it a long train of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities; The other, that is the Figurative do not ſo? Have we not reaſon enough without adviſing with Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion about the matter, to reject the Literal ſenſe and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the Spiritual? S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> certainly thought we had. For he gives us this direction in his Book <hi>de Doctrinâ Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianâ;</hi> and the firſt and fitteſt Text that he could chooſe to exemplifie his Rule, what think you is it? even the Couſin-German to that which you have made choice of. <hi>Unleſs you eat the fleſh of the Son of Man, &amp;c.</hi> Here ſaith he, the Letter ſeems to command impiety. <hi>Figura eſt ergo.</hi> Therefore it is a Figure commanding to feed devoutly, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Paſſion of our Lord, and to lay up in our memory that Chriſt was crucified for us.</p>

                     <p>Theſe particulars peradventure would require a further diſcuſſion, and now I will take nothing but what is undeniable. As this is, to wit, That what points are in Controverſie betwixt us and Proteſtants, we believe to have been delivered by Chriſt and his Apoſtles to our fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers, and by them delivered from hand to hand to our Fathers, whom we know to have delivered them for ſuch to us, and to have received and believed them for ſuch themſelves.</p>
                     <p>Certainly though Ink and Paper cannot bluſh, yet I dare ſay you were fain to rub your forehead over and over before you committed this to Writing. Say what you liſt, for my part I am ſo far from believing you, that I verily believe you do not believe your ſelves, when you pretend that you believe thoſe points of your Doctrin which are in controverſie, to have been delivered to your Forefathers by Chriſt and his Apoſtles. Is it poſſible that any ſober man who has read the New Teſtament, ſhould believe that Chriſt and his Apoſtles taught Chriſtians, That it
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:57896:282"/>was fit and lawful to deny the Laity the Sacramental Cup: That it was expedient and for the edification of the Church, that the Scripture ſhould be read, and the publick worſhip of God perpetually celebrated in a language which they underſtand not, and to which for want of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, (unleſs S. <hi>Paul</hi> deceive us) they cannot ſay <hi>Amen:</hi> Or is it reaſonable you ſhould deſire us to believe you, when your own Men, your own Champions, your own Councils confeſs the contrary?</p>
                     <p>Does not the Council of <hi>Conſtance</hi> acknowledg plainly, That the cuſtom which they ratified, was contrary to Chriſts inſtitution, and the cuſtom of the Primitive Church? and how then was it taught by Chriſt and his Apoſtles?</p>
                     <p>Do not <hi>Cajetan</hi> and <hi>Lyranus</hi> confeſs ingenuouſly, that it follows evidently from S. <hi>Paul,</hi> that it is more for edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, that the Liturgy of the Church ſhould be in ſuch a Language as the Aſſiſtants underſtand?</p>
                     <p>The like Confeſſion we have from others concerning Purgatory and Indulgences.</p>
                     <p>Others acknowledges the Apoſtles never taught Invoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Saints.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Rhenanus</hi> ſays as much touching Auricular Confeſſion.</p>
                     <p>It is evident from <hi>Peter Lombard</hi> that the Doctrin of Tranſubſtantiation was not a point of Faith in his time.</p>
                     <p>From <hi>Pius Mirandula</hi> that the Infallibility of the Church was no Article, much leſs a foundation of Faith in his time.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Bellarmine</hi> acknowledges that the Saints enjoying the Viſion of God before the day of judgment was no Article of Faith in the time of Pope <hi>John</hi> the XXII.</p>
                     <p>But as the Proverb is, when Thieves fall out, true men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover their goods: ſo how ſmall and heartleſs the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is to ancient Tradition, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be more plainly diſcovered, than by the Quarrels which her Champions have amongſt themſelves, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally about the Immaculate conception of the Bleſſed Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin.</p>
                     <pb n="124" facs="tcp:57896:283"/>
                     <p>The Patrons of the Negative opinion, <hi>Cajetan, Bannes, Bandellus</hi> and <hi>Canus,</hi> alledg for it, Firſt an whole army of Scriptures, Councils and Fathers, agreeing unanimouſly in this Doctrin, That only Chriſt was free from ſin. Then, an innumerous multitude of Fathers expreſly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming the very point in queſtion, not contradicted by any of their Contemporaries, or Predeceſſors, or indeed of their Succeſſors for many ages.</p>
                     <p>All the Holy Fathers agree in this, that the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> was conceived in Original ſin. So

                        <hi>Cajetan</hi> brings for it fifteen Fathers in his judgment irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fragable, others produce two hundred, <hi>Bandellus</hi> almoſt three hundred. Thus

                     <p>That all the Holy Fathers who have fallen upon the mention of this matter, with one mouth affirm, that the Bleſſed Virgin was conceived in Original ſin. So

                     </p>
                     <p>And after,—That the contrary Doctrin has neither Scripture nor Tradition for it. For (ſaith he) no Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons can be derived unto us but by the Biſhops and Holy Fathers, the Succeſſors of the Apoſtles, and it is certain that thoſe ancient writers received it not from their prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors.</p>
                     <p>Now againſt this ſtream of ancient Writers, <hi>when</hi> the contrary new Doctrin came in, and how it prevailed, it will be worth the conſidering.</p>

<note n="†" place="margin">Seſſ XXXVI.</note> 
                        <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſil,</hi> (which <hi>Binius</hi> tells us was reprobated but in part, to wit, in the point of the Authority of Councils, and in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of <hi>Eugenius</hi> the Pope) it was defined and declared, to be Holy Doctrin, and conſonant to the worſhip of the
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:57896:283"/>Church, to the Catholick Faith, to right Reaſon and the Holy Scripture, and to be approved, held and embraced by all Catholicks: and that it ſhould be lawful for no man for the time to come to preach or teach the contrary. The cuſtom alſo of keeping the Feaſt of her Holy Conception, which before was but particular to the <hi>Roman</hi> and ſome other Churches, and it ſeems ſomewhat neglected, was then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed and made Univerſal; and commanded to be cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated—<hi>ſub nomine Conception is—under the name of the Conception. Binius</hi> in a Marginal note tells us indeed, That they celebrate not this Feaſt in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> by virtue of this Renovation, — <hi>cum eſſet Conciliabalum</hi>—be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this was the act not of a Council, but of a Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle, yet he himſelf in his Index, ſtiles it the Oecomeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Council of <hi>Baſil,</hi> and tells that it was reprobated only in two points, of which this is none. Now whom ſhall we believe, <hi>Binius</hi> in his Margin, or <hi>Binius</hi> in his Index?</p>
                     <p>Yet in after-times Pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> IV. and <hi>Pius</hi> V. thought not this Decree ſo binding, but that they might and did again put life into the condemned opinion, giving liberty by their conſtitutions to all men to hold and maintain either part, either that the Bleſſed Virgin was conceived with O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal ſin or was not. Which Conſtitution of <hi>Sixtus</hi> IV. The
<note n="*" place="margin">Seſſ. V.</note> Council of <hi>Trent</hi> renewed and confirmed.</p>
                     <p>But the wheel again turning, and the Negative opinion prevailing, The Affirmative was baniſht, firſt by a Decree of <hi>Paul</hi> V. from all publick Sermons, Lectures, Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and all publick Acts whatſoever: and ſince by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Decree of <hi>Gregory</hi> XV. from all private Writings, and private Conferences.</p>
                     <p>But yet all this contents not the Univerſity of <hi>Paris.</hi> They, as <hi>Salmeron</hi> tells us, admit none to the Degree of Doctor of Divinity, unleſs they have firſt bound them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by ſolemn Oath to maintain the Immaculate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of the Bleſſed Virgin.</p>
                     <p>Now I beſeech you Mr. <hi>R.</hi>—conſider your courſes with ſome indifference.</p>
                     <pb n="126" facs="tcp:57896:284"/>
                     <p>Firſt, You take Authority upon you, againſt the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal, conſtant, unoppoſed Tradition of the Church for many ages: to ſet up as a rival, a new upſtart yeſterdays invention: and to give all men liberty to hold which they pleaſe. So Pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> IV. The Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> and <hi>Pius</hi> V. that is, you make it lawful to hold the ancient Faith, or not to hold it, nay to hold the contrary. This is high preſumption. But you ſtay not here; For,</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The ancient Doctrin you cloyſter and hook up within the narrow, cloſe and dark rooms of the thoughts and brains of the defenders of it, forbidding them upon pain of damnation ſo much as to whiſper it in their private diſcourſes and writings: and in the mean time the New Doctrin you ſet at full liberty, and give leave, nay coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and encouragement to all men to employ their time and wits and tongues and pens, in the maintenance and propagation of it.

                     <p>Thirdly, You bind men by Oaths to defend the new opinion, and to oppoſe the ancient. So the Univerſity of <hi>Paris.</hi> Yet ſtill you proceed further; For,</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, By your General Councils confirmed by your Popes, you have declared and defined, that this new in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention is agreeable, and conſequently that the ancient Doctrin is repugnant to the Catholick Faith, to Reaſon, to the Holy Scripture. So the Council of <hi>Baſil.</hi>

                     <p>Theſe things I entreat you weigh well in your Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and put not into the Scale above a juſt allowance, not above three grains of partiality, and then tell me whether you can with reaſon or with modeſty ſuppoſe or deſire that we ſhould believe, or think that you believe, that all the points of Doctrin which you conteſt againſt us, were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered at firſt by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and have ever ſince by the Succeſſion of Biſhops and Paſtors been preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved inviolate and propagated unto you.</p>
                     <p>The Patrons I confeſs of this new Invention ſet not much by the Decree of the Council of <hi>Baſil</hi> for it, but plead very hard for a full and final definition of it from the Sea
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:57896:284"/>Apoſtolick: and finding the conſpiring oppoſition of the ancient Fathers to be the main impediment of their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, it is ſtrange to ſee how confidently they ride over them.</p>

Neither ſhalt thou in judgment yield to the ſentence of many to depart from the truth. <hi>For when the</hi> Donatiſts <hi>gloried in the multitude of their Authors, S.</hi> Auſtin <hi>anſwered</hi> it was a ſign of a cauſe deſtitute of truth, to rely only up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Authority of many men which may err.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>It falls out ſometimes alſo that from ſome one Doctor, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if he be famous, proceeds a multitude of followers of his O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, and ſome, taken with an humble and pious fear, chooſe rather to follow the Opinion of another againſt their mind, than to bring out of their own wit any thing new, leſt they ſhould ſo bring any new thing into the Church. Whoſe humility as it is to be praiſed, ſo the confidence of others is not to be condemned, who for the love of truth fear not to bring in better things. Thus S.</hi> Hierome <hi>in his Sermon of the Aſſumption, if it be his, fears to affirm that the Virgin</hi> Mary <hi>is aſſumed into Heaven, and thinks it rather to be piouſly deſired, than raſhly defined. But
<note n="*" place="margin">In the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gint here he ſays, <hi>The Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin of S.</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin <hi>alone hath brought into the Church the Worſhip of the bleſſed Virgins Aſſumption.</hi>
                           </note> S.</hi> Auſtin <hi>more happily dared to affirm it, and ſettle it with many argument, by which adventure this the Church hath
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:57896:285"/>gained, that perſwaded by his reaſons ſhe hath believed it, and celebrates it in her worſhip.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But they fetch their arguments from the Antiquity of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, to which always greater honour was given than to No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velties. But I anſwer, old men are praiſers of ancient times, but we affirm, the younger the Doctors are, the more perſpicacious. Moreover we ſay that although they were ancient yet they were men, and themſelves held under the darkneſs of Original ſin and might err. But go to, who are theſe Ancients? are they A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles? are they</hi> Ambroſe <hi>or</hi> Hierom, <hi>or</hi> Auſtin? <hi>but none of them diſcuſs'd this Controverſie on purpoſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Chryſoſtom <hi>is oppoſed in his Commentary on S.</hi> Matthew, <hi>where he ſaith</hi> though Chriſt were not a ſinner, yet he has humane Nature from a ſinner. <hi>Underſtand</hi> (ſays <hi>Salmeron</hi>) <hi>from her who of her ſelf, and according to the condition of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was a ſinner.</hi> Thomas <hi>ſays that</hi> Chryſoſtom <hi>ſpeaks ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitantly, for he conſtitutes the</hi> Virgin <hi>under actual ſin. Or that the Commentaries which go up and down under his name ane not his. Or that theſe paſſages are adjectitious. Or if they be indeed his, with the good leave and favour of ſo great a man, they are to be rejected. Neither ought any man to marvel that he &amp;</hi> Bernard, <hi>and</hi> Thomas, <hi>and</hi> Bonaventure, <hi>and</hi> Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander <hi>of</hi> Ales, <hi>and</hi> Albert, <hi>and</hi> Durand, <hi>and</hi> Egidius; <hi>and Laſtly, The greater part followed that opinion: both becauſe they were men, and becauſe in progreſs of time, new myſteries are revealed which before were unknown. — For as holineſs of life purgeth no man from ſin, ſo it frees no man from danger of error. — Every age finds out ſome verities proper to it ſelf, which the former ages were ignorant of,</hi>—and there in the Margin, <hi>Every age hath its peculiar divine revelations.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus far <hi>Salmeron,</hi> by whom we may ſee, That <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants</hi> are not the only men who ſay that the Fathers may err: but that <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> too, can and dare valiantly break through, and tread under their feet (though perhaps with cap in hand, and ſome ſhew of reverence) and even ride over whole bands of Fathers when they ſtand in their way.</p>
                     <pb n="129" facs="tcp:57896:285"/>
                     <p>Another great <hi>Achilles</hi> for the ſame opinion is one <hi>Joan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes Baptiſta Poza,</hi> a Jeſuite, and Profeſſor of Divinity at <hi>Complutum:</hi> He in his fourth Book of his <hi>Elacidarium Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parae,</hi> pleads very earneſtly to have it defined, and labours very luſtily to remove all exceptions to the contrary, but above all thoſe many ones, — That there is no Tradition for it, That the ſtream of Ancient Tradition is againſt, and therefore well and worthily may it be condemned for an Hereſie: but to be Canonized among the Articles of Faith, it can with no reaſon expect.</p>
                     <p>To the Second exception he brings two anſwers which <hi>Salmeron</hi> it ſeems forgot, in the proſecution whereof he hath many excellent paſſages, which I have thought good to cull out of him to evidence the wonderful reverence, and conſtant regard of the preſent Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> to the Tradition of the Ancient.</p>
                     <p>The firſt, That it is poſſible the Writings of the Fathers out of which theſe Teſtimonies againſt the <hi>Immaculate conception</hi> are taken, may be corrupted: But to ſhew it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable they are ſo in theſe places, he ſpeaks not one word of ſenſe, nor ſo much as any colourable reaſon, unleſs this may paſs for one (as perhaps it may where reaſons are ſcarce.) No propoſition, which contradicts the common judgment of the Fathers can be probable,;
<note n="*" place="margin">I ſhould ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſubſume, but this does ſo. Therefore not probable.</note> But it is <hi>de fide</hi> that our opinion is probable, for the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> hath made it ſo by giving liberty to all to hold it. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore without doubt we muſt hold, that it is not (whatſoever it ſeems) againſt the common judgment of the Fathers. This argument ſaith he doth moſt illuſtriouſly convince the followers of the contrary opinion: that they ought not to dare affirm hereafter, that their opinion flowes from the common judgment and writings of the ancient Doctors.</p>
                     <p>His ſecond anſwer is, That whereas <hi>Bandillus</hi> and <hi>Caje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,</hi> &amp;c. produce general ſayings of <hi>Irenaeus, Origen, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanaſius, Theophilus Alexandrinus, Greg. Nyſſen, Baſil, Greg. Naz. Cyprian, Hierom, Fulgentius,</hi> and in a manner of all the ancient Fathers, exempting Chriſt alone from, and conſequently concluding the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> under Original
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:57896:286"/>ſin, which Argument muſt needs conclude if the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> be not Chriſt. His anſwer I ſay is, Theſe Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies have little or no ſtrength: for did they conclude, we muſt then (let us in Gods name) ſay that the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> committed alſo many venial ſins: For the Scriptures, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and Councils ſet forth in propoſitions as Univerſal. That there is no man but Chriſt who is not often defiled at leaſt with ſmaller ſins, and who may not juſtly ſay that Petition of our Lords Prayer, <hi>Demitte nobis debita noſtra.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>An anſwer I confeſs as fit as a Napkin to ſtop the mouths of his domeſtick adverſaries, though no way fit to ſatisfie their reaſon. But this man little thought there were <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in the world as well as <hi>Dominicans,</hi> who will not much be troubled by thieves falling out, to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver more of their goods than they expected, and to ſee a prevaricating Jeſuit, inſtead of ſtopping one breach in their ruinous cauſe, to make two. For whereas this man argues from the deſtruction of the Conſequent to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the Antecedent thus: If theſe teſtimonies were good and concluding, then the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> ſhould have been guilty not only of Original but alſo of actual ſin, But the Conſequent is falſe and blaſphemous: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Antecedent is not true. They on the others ſide argue, and ſure with much more reaſon, and much more conformity to the Ancient Tradition: From the Aſſertion of the Antecedent to the Aſſertion of the Conſequent, thus: If theſe teſtimonies be good and concluding, then the Bleſſed Virgin was guilty both of Original ſin and Actual; but the Teſtimonies are good and concluding; therefore ſhe was guilty even of actual ſins, and therefore much more of Original.</p>
                     <p>His Third Anſwer is, That their Church hath, or may define many other things againſt which (if their works be not depraved) there lies a greater conſent of Fathers, than againſt the Immaculate Conception, and therefore why not this?</p>
                     <p>The Inſtances he gives are four.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That the Bleſſed Virgin committed no actual ſin.</p>
                     <pb n="131" facs="tcp:57896:286"/>
                     <p n="2">2. That the Angels were not created before the viſible world.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That Angels are Incorporeal.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. That the Souls of Saints departed are made happy by the Viſion of God before the day of Judgment.</p>
                     <p>Againſt the firſt Opinion he alledges direct places out of <hi>Origen,</hi> which he ſays admit no expoſition; though <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melius</hi> upon <hi>Tertullian,</hi> and <hi>Sixtus Senenſis</hi> labour in vain to put a good ſenſe on them. — Out of <hi>Euthymias</hi> and <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phylact:</hi> Out of S. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> divers pregnant teſtimonies, and S. <hi>Thomas</hi> his confeſſion touching one of them, out of the Author of the Queſtions of the New and Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> cap. 75. Out of S. <hi>Hilary</hi> upon <hi>Pſa.</hi> 118. which words yet ſays he <hi>Tolet</hi> has drawn to a good conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: yet ſo much difficulty ſtill remains in them. — Out of <hi>Tertullian de carne Chriſti</hi> cap. 7. which he tells us will not be ſalved by <hi>Pamelius</hi> his gloſs. — Out of <hi>Athanafius,</hi> out of <hi>Irenaeus</hi> III. 18. out of S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> lib. 2. <hi>de Symbolo ad Catech.</hi> cap. 5. Whoſe words yet, becauſe they admit, ſays <hi>Poza,</hi> ſome expoſition, I thought fit to ſuppreſs, though ſome think they are very hard to be avoided. Out of <hi>Greg. Nyſſ.</hi>—out of S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> in his Sermon on the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: Whoſe words, ſays he; though they may by ſome means be eluded, yet will always be very difficult if we examin the Antecedents and Conſequents: out of <hi>Anſelm, Rich. de</hi> S. <hi>Victor,</hi> S. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> S. <hi>Andrew</hi> of <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> and S. <hi>Bede</hi> and then tells us there are many other Teſtimonies much reſembling theſe: and beſides many Fathers and Texts of Scripture, which exempt Chriſt only from actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ſin, and laſtly, many ſuſpicious ſayings againſt her Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity in them, who uſe to ſay that at the Angels An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation ſhe was cleanſed and purged and expiated from all faults committed by her freewill, which ſaith he, though <hi>Caniſius</hi> and others explicate in a pious ſenſe, yet at leaſt they ſhew, that either thoſe alledged againſt the Imaculate conception are as favourable to be expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: Or we muſt ſay, that a verity may be defined by the See Apoſtolick againſt the judgment of ſome Fathers.</p>
                     <pb n="132" facs="tcp:57896:287"/>
                     <p>From theſe things, ſays he, is drawn an unanſwerable reaſon, That for the defining the purity of the concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nothing now is wanting. For ſeeing, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more and more convincing teſtimonies of Fathers who either did, or did ſeem to aſcribe actual ſin to the Bleſſed Virgin; notwithſtanding the Univerſal ſayings of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture and Councils bringing all, except Chriſt, under ſin: Laſtly, notwithſtanding the ſilence of the Scriptures and Councils touching her Immunity from actual ſin, ſeeing notwithſtanding all this the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> hath either decreed,
<note place="margin">Seff. VI. c. 23. de Juſtifical.</note> or hath confirmed, it being before decreed by the conſent of the faithful, that the Bleſſed Virgin never was guilty of any voluntary, no not the leaſt ſin: It follows certainly that the Apoſtolick See, hath as good nay bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ground, to enrol amongſt her Articles the Virgins Immaculate conception: The reaſon is clear, for neither are there ſo many nor ſo evident ſentences of Fathers which impute any fault or blemiſh to the Conception of the Mother of God, as there are in appearance to charge her with actual offences. Neither are there fewer Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal propoſitions in Scripture, by which it may be proved that only Jeſus was free from actual ſin, and therefore that the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> fell into it. Neither can there at this time be deſired a greater conſent of the faithful, nor a more ardent deſire than there now is, that this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity ſhould be defined, and that the contrary Opinion ſhould be Anathematized for Erroneous and Heretical. The words of the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> on which this reaſon is grounded are theſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>If any man ſay, That a man all his life long may avoid all, even venial ſins, unleſs by ſpecial priviledge from God, as the Church holds of the Bleſſed Virgin, let him be Anathema.</hi> But if the conſent of the Church hath prevailed againſt more clear Teſtimonies of ancient Fathers, even for that which is favoured with no expreſs authority of Scriptures or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils: And if the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> upon this conſent of the faithful, hath either defined this Immunity of the Virgin, from all actual ſin, or declared it to be defined: Who then
<pb facs="tcp:57896:287"/>can deny but that the Church hath immediate power to define among the Articles of Faith, the pious Opinion of the Immaculate Conception?</p>
                     <p>His ſecond Example by which he declares the power of their Church to define Articles againſt a multitude of Fathers (and conſequently not only without but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Tradition) is the opinion that Angels were not created before the Corporeal world was created: which ſaith he is, or may be defined, though there were more Teſtimonies of Fathers againſt it, than againſt the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maculate Conception. So he ſays in the Argument of his Fifth Chapter, and in the end of the ſame Chapter: The Council of <hi>Lateran</hi> hath defined this againſt the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs judgment of twenty Fathers, of which <hi>Nazianzen, Baſil, Chryſoſtome, Cyrill, Hierom, Ambroſe,</hi> and <hi>Hillary</hi> are part.</p>
                     <p>His third Example to the ſame purpoſe, is the opinion that Angels are Incorporeal: againſt which ſaith he, in the Argument of his ſixth Chapter: there are more Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies of the Fathers, than againſt the Immaculate Conception, and yet it is, or at leaſt may be defined by the Church, and in the end of the Chapter, I have for this Opinion cited twenty three Fathers, which as moſt men think is now condemned in the
<note n="*" place="margin">Firm de ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mâ Trinitate.</note> 
                        <hi>Lateran</hi> Council, or at leaſt as
<note n="†" place="margin">De Angelis. lib. 6.</note> 
                        <hi>Suarez</hi> proves, is to be rejected as mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly temerarious.</p>
                     <p>His fourth and laſt Example to the ſame purpoſe is, The Opinion that the Souls of Saints departed enjoy the Viſion of God before the Reſurrection. Againſt which he tells us in the firſt place was the Judgment of Pope <hi>John</hi> XXI. though not as a Pope but as a private Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor. Then he muſters up againſt it a great multitude of <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Fathers, touching which he ſays—All theſe Teſtimonies when
<note n="*" place="margin">1. 2. D. 29. cap. 1.</note> 
                        <hi>Vaſquez</hi> has related, at length he
<note n="†" place="margin">cap. 3.</note> anſwers that they might be ſo explained as to ſay nothing againſt the true and Catholick Doctrin. Yet if they could not be ſo explained, their Authority ought not to hinder us from embracing that which the
<pb facs="tcp:57896:288"/>Church <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 words">
                           <desc>〈◊◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>. The ſame argument I make (ſays <hi>Pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap>)</hi> The Fathers and ancient Doctors which are obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted againſt the pious opinion of the Conception of the Virgin, may be commodiouſly explicated, or at leaſt ſo handled that they ſhall not hurt: Notwithſtanding though they cannot be explicated, ſome of them, that their Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies ought not to hinder, but that the Sea Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick may define the Bleſſed Virgins preſervation from Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal ſin. In fine, for the cloſe of this Argument he adds, <hi>Nolo per plura.</hi> —I will not run through more Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples: Theſe that I have reckoned are ſufficient, and admoniſhes learned men to bring together other like proofs, whereby they may promote the deſired Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
